Superb car like as fantastic as petroleum car. Speed is superb. I bought this 2 months ago and it looks premium and fantastic. The car is amazing. This is one of the most number 1 car in the sports car market.
"Anti national, worst service, worst customer car, worst dealings to indian customers, over priced, less mileage huge maintenance cost, have better options in India other than Hyundai."
Super happy with it. The car is too good
"Pretty good car, smooth as a glider fast car, instant pickup and the range in one charge is also pretty good as well, so we can go more miles, a catchy car grab our eye balls everyone wants to ride this"
Price difference between petrol and electronic could not convince customer to buy electronic car. Difference amount can use for Life time use of petrol diesel car. Moreover long ride is big concern for charging. Only useful for fix route of almost 100 km. Price should be reduced and charging pump should be developed more.
"Except for the short legroom in the rear, this is a performance car. I wish they are completely removed the boot as electrics will be only a second or third car in most families. This would have given far more leg room for rear passengers. Brilliant car otherwise."
Good experience good driving experience all performance good very low maintenance good buying experience and driving experience and good looking wise and good performance etc. Low maintenance
Great car purchased from Hindustan Hyundai in Jaipur. Happy with their customer service and staff. Would definitely encourage my family to purchase from them and this car is fabulous.

"Such a very excellent drive, very comfortable, digital and save environment save fuel for future energy. So sporty feel and save money they help easy life and fast-changing option entire zone so cool future tech."
Its so amazing and they give best performance. Its battery backup also cool and i like its fast charging. It is more useful for our future. But it is so costly. My advice to add solar panel on the roof.
I like this car very much. Because this car is very comfortable for all. I love this car. Riding is very smooth. It fills like a sport car. Servicing method are very easy . This car looking very sporty. This car is this car is very fast . I buy the car then I show this to my family they will very happy to see this car. Because my all family members are like a sport car.
"I bought this electric car 2 months back, driven 9900 kms until now. It runs 250 kms around with a single charge comfortably with AC on. Then u have to charge for complete peace of mind. Price high but u get 40% depreciation in your ITR for consecutive 4 years which means u haven't paid anything except for insurance and RTO. please make this car with two sets of battery, one for 250 kms and other for 125 kms, and alternatively, they should get charged by the regenerative power energy source and kinetic energy too thus KONA will go beyond 1000 kms. Very smooth, silent ride. Cruise control and hill assist presently. 2 negative points. Rear seats not having any fan facility and rear shockers are not too good."
"Amazing,Amazing Fully electric car with amazing power delivery and Battery efficiency with amazing warrenty. Hyundai did great job. Surely Hyundai is the Future for Automotive One thing in India the govt must reduce the tax of this car.. by govt tax its around 30lakh in my city.. but with out tax its about 25lakh... Indian Govt please reduce the tax.."
So here it is the hyundai kona electric the car which completely changed the electric segment in the indian car industry to driving experience with high acceleration long distances
I m observing this car from 6 months.. And finally it is launched.. Have talk with the local dealer of hyundai about test drive and booking.. It looks amazing with all features in one roof. And with 8 years battery guarantee.. It's great car in India.. As per price wise it's some expensive. Must work on price for future of car.
Electric car it's an copy of i20 Charging time is too slow 25lakh is higher it's too costly because of its rate most of the customers will not prefer for the electric car..if its below 16lakh the car konac will be up I n Indian market.... they have to introduce more charging stations or points in highways
Everything is premium about the car the seats suspension drivetrain power really dont want to see another I.C engine car ever after this beauty offering 8 years warranty is amazing its best value for people who do 15000 or more kms a year looks are good from the front i wish tuesday rear was done better service and maintenance is almost zero and car pays back for its self its like buying solar panels
This is very important segment in our Indian car market and costumers setisfaction it's Zero fuel emulsion but one point disappointed its price other side all things are good before this segment in our country no big options in this segment but now we people's we have choices and also better option in future after coming this car so m very excited for this product thank you
Everything is ok. And I greatly appreciate Hyundai's innovation in bringing electric cars but the price for this is too much and even if the gst gets reduced it will come about 20l but there are many competitors in that range except for the electric transmission. To be successful in Indian market they should 1.Reduce the price 2.implement more electric stations around major cities 3.service should be improved incase for electric cars 4.free service should be given for at least 8 times Anyway hatsoff for Hyundai for their innovative electric car in Indian roads
Wonderful Hyundai love u Brand amazing driving break comfort sit and super engine and body is very much I like careem colour and premium service and the same time and consideration for the first time I think it would have been able in my life of this communication including attachments are handled a great
One of the best EV car available in India with very good range. The price is also the best according to the standards of the car and such a long range drive in one charge. The power is decent which is sufficient for Indian road users. The best part of the car is you can save a lot of money while protecting the environment.
All off good in this car.i really about to buy it. Excellent car. Hyundai is best company of the year. Its great to drive kona.i love Hyundai verna to. Hyundai is the great customer support. So nicely care about car. And fuel economy is the always satisfied.driving performance are also cool.i like this car.
Car is ok... Looking awssmmm and all... But huge question is still now i dint seen of any electric stations...also cost of the car s too much... Not happy Another thing is wat so difference of using petrol/diesel and electric cars... To reduce the pollution... If it is soo you guyz producing battery for large size in factory... Tat ll not make pollution??
"As we all know the future is all with electric vehicles, and we didn't yet had any top edge EV cars in india we only had was the Tata tigor and mahindra ev which are the worst ev's, but this kona had impressed me a lot more than petrol cars, it had a seat warmer which is a new feature that is only available in luxury cars, the pick up was awesome, the drive was so smooth. All I want to say is just go a head and purchase it, don't think about charging it takes only 2 hrs hardly to charge it quickly with the DC Charger,. GO GREELECTRICAL SAVE ENVIRONMENT."
"Best car i hv drive till date it is so comfortable that like you are at your home so please buy it fuel efficiency is good very interesting car in this price segment that you see in market,. Thanku Hyundai for launching such beautiful car it hv made our drive hobby and i m fully addicted to this car.."
It is very good car which help the country from pollution and saves the environment. Its maintenance and servicing cost is also very low as compared to other cars therefore in future we see electric cars between us which is very helpful for our country .if I bought this car then I will be very thankful to that person who had made this car

Hyundai Kona Electric is extremely good car but expensive for its size and performance. We should wait for reduction in GST and road tax which is likely to reduce the price by couple of lakh rupees. If or as And when car is available for Rs 20-22 lakh I for sure will buy it. Electric cars indeed would be cheaper to operate.
An i20 for 30 lac. Good. That's a car worth buying. 452 mileage arai certified. That's a joke right. Actual will be half than claimed. I'm waiting for maruti to launch it's electric version of wagon R for the price of 12 lac. What if ur warranty runs out and you need battery change then what. Re finance it again.
"Car is amazing car comes with every safety features , but need charging points all over the country and price is higher can't able to buy for middle class people i my opinion they should have base variant in that case price will be affordable for everyone i hope hyndai will launch more basic variant electric cars"
So the future of Indian cars have arrived! Hyundai certainly has heated up the competition in EV segment too now...As currently the Kona Electric is completely build unit that's why the initial cost is looking a bit high because of import tax etc..I hope that it gets upto 20 lakhs after complete manufacturing in India! This is a bang on car and all the best to Hyundai for this!
Wow its an awesome car. And a great car for all people. But they are not launched by manual gear. This are the mistakes. If they launched the manual gear its very great. Please fix an manual gear as soon as posible. While iam seeing the Hyundai car all are awesome. So all of u just trust the Hyundai and buy the car.
