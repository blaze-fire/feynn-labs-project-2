Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"Hello All, I have been planning to post the ownership review of my Hyundai Kona for the past few months. However, thanks to the current situations it has been delayed till now. Now that I’ve finally gotten around to it, hopefully it helps someone on the forum making a decision.
The car was purchased in February 2020, and has now crossed 5000kms on the odo. The car was originally offered with 3 years unlimited kms warranty, but there is now an option for extending the warranty to 5 years/50,000kms or 4 years/60,000kms. Three free services offered, first one is at the 1000 km mark which has been completed. Otherwise the service interval is 10,000 km.

Quick summary
Pros –
Acceleration
Silent drive, there’s literally no sound other than a vague electrical whir that is only audible when you are really going hard
Light steering, makes city driving easy
Paddles, that allow single pedal driving
Switches for changing drive modes, takes a while to get used to. But after that it’s very intuitive.
Range lives upto promised 350 kms mark
Electric driver seat adjustment, means finding your favorite position is very easy
I am not going to add the fact that it’s an EV in either the pros or cons, as that should be decided at the end of the review.

Cons –
Size, it’s really the size of small hatchback. Consider the raised floor for rear passengers, then it’s really a 3 seater at best.
Low ground clearance, you will bump into raised speed breakers and low approach angle means that ramps need to be carefully planned
LED headlamps don’t have a long throw

The Reasons for buying
In the pre-pandemic days, I owned a XUV500 as a daily driver and had a heavy daily usage of 100-150kms. The overall driving experience was good, but the only concern was the huge running costs. Mileage of 11-12 kmpl meant that there was atleast 20k being spent on fuel expenses. Factor in the service costs that are on the higher side, and the costs were becoming a slight concern. I had anyways planned for changing the car after completing 100,000 kms and was looking for moving to a car with higher mileage. However, upgrading from a XUV500 is a tough choice. The next level of SUVs are too high in price, and the sedans have many trade-offs (such as reliability or service concerns). This was around the time when Kona Electric was announced. I keenly followed the updates and was hoping for an aggressive pricing. The announced price was not along expected lines, however the GST cut made it within budget again. There was hope that the next car was found.

Hyderabad had only two dealers identified for the Kona. I applied for the test drive online, and to no surprise in the pre-covid world, the response was very delayed. And even after the response from the sales team, no one from the dealer reached out to me. Busy with work, I didn’t follow up. A month later, relatively free, I asked for a test drive again online. This time the response was much better. A test drive was arranged within a week. The first drive was a revelation. The acceleration and silence was something else. However, it was a significantly smaller car in comparison to the XUV. The official T-BHP review of Kona references the harsh ride, but in the test drive I didn’t find it too bad. The sales person mentioned that the full charge would be about 70 units and a quick calculation confirmed that would mean about 300 Rs. And the range was confirmed by some of the early customers to be around 330 kms. My mind was made up after the first drive.

The other Contenders
Around the same time, the MG ZS eV was also announced but didn’t have the price details. The global reviews confirmed that the car was half a size bigger than the Kona and did have better interiors. However, having had a terrible experience with a new entrant to India (Nissan) my appetite for unestablished players was not too high. I did ask for a test drive, again online, but there was no response even after the car was announced and test drives had begun (Funnily, MG was very aggressive with Hector and had reached out to me for a test drive even though I never asked for it. The sales person mentioned that they were reaching out voluntarily to prospective customers). Subjective opinion, but I also feel that the exterior design of the car is very bland. There isn’t enough done to differentiate the EV from the IC car, and there’s really no wow factor that would make others look at the car. (MG fans, this was clearly a case of me following the heart over the head. Logically, I would say the ZS beats Kona across many parameters.)

The Tata Nexon EV was also announced, but the lack of safety features and concerns on Tata’s reputation for new tech made me steer away. The range of 200 kms was also too low for my liking. I did ask for a test drive, and the central call center reacted really fast promising a drive within a day, but true to their reputation the dealers responded an age later after I had taken delivery of the Kona.

Booking and Delivery Experience
I made the booking online through the Hyundai portal. The color chosen was Blue. Though KUN Hyundai only had the Lakdi-ka-pul dealership for the EV sales, the ECIL dealership (much closer to my home) managed all of the process. Shared the details with the dealer and they told me that the delivery timelines would be around 3 months. Unexpectedly, within a month after the booking I received a call from the dealer who indicated that they had a vehicle with my color choice available now. Someone had booked it and cancelled. I did a quick check of the finances and decided to go ahead. This was late January, and no one had the foresight of what was to come thanks to Covid-19. In hindsight, if the actual 3 month waiting period would have happened I probably wouldn’t have changed the car. But I am glad that didn’t happen. The delivery process was super smooth and the team ensured to make all arrangements as requested by me. The ECIL dealer requested to deliver it from their premises, and I was the first EV to be sold from there. Special shout out to the team here, who were really responsive to all of my queries. They even managed to get the vehicle to their center for an additional test drive with all of the family. Home charger was installed on the day of the delivery. Some pics from the delivery day.





Driving Experience
As most of you know, the instant acceleration is the USP for EVs. But once you start driving an EV, then you realize that the change is much more than that. If I could simplify the difference, I would probably say it is the equivalent of using iOS vs Android. Android revels in the user customizations, whereas iOS is all about the simplified user experience. This is how it is for EVs as well. There really isn’t much for you to worry about beyond the charge. It is as simple as the bygone catchphrase of “fill it, shut it, forget it”. I would re-phrase it as “plug in, plug out, enjoy, repeat”. The car is super smooth, there are no jerks at any time. The car is so silent, that it actually spoils the experience for all other IC cars. It is as simple as get in, push the buttons and start driving. Set it in your preferred brake regen and you don’t even need to use the brake that often. Just pay attention to the driving environment, the traffic signals and the car will do everything else for you. It’s really stress free, and in fact my road rage has completely disappeared. On a side note, traffic density and disregard for rules seems to have increased post lockdown, and I really would have been stressed out in the XUV.

The car also comes loaded with all the driver comforts – Apple carplay, sunroof, ventilated seats etc. Special call out to the paddles, the adjustable regen braking really makes single pedal driving possible. But you have to be really careful with the paddle braking. They are not to be used for emergency braking, but once you have started using them you’ll always know when to use brakes and when to use paddles. Also, while we can use the paddles to change the regen braking, based on my experience I find that leaving the regen at level 2 is much easier to use and I use the paddle only for the braking. This has automatically improved my consumption figures.

But it’s not all positives, the one downside would be that it’s really punishing on your driving style. And unlike IC cars, there’s no hiding. The feedback is instantaneous and you’ll know what you’ve done. Drive very aggressively for more than a few kms and the reduction in range will be quite apparent. The equivalent of kmpl is the KWH/100Kms. Unlike fuel consumption, the lower is better. This number is generally in the range of 11-13 for general driving. The battery pack is 39 KW, which translates to a range of 300kms (13 KWH/100kms) to 350 kms (11 KWH/100kms). However, drive more sedately and you can also experience figures of 9-10 KWH/100kms. However, these figures can be changed with one stretch of aggressive driving. That’s why I said it’s punishing. But, if you’re not concerned about the range or consumption data, then have fun and this is the perfect machine for that. Coming to the actual figures, I’ve experienced range of 330 kms on average. My average consumption has been 11-12 KWH/100kms.

Another downside is the low ground clearance. Speed breakers that I would’ve sailed over earlier, now have to be negotiated carefully. Also, the low front end means that ramps have to be planned for else you will scrape the front end. Hyundai is selling this car as a CSUV, it’s got a lower GC than the Swift (2nd gen). However, on the occasions you do hit something the underbody is very strong. I once accidentally turned onto a cement drain, the entire piece of concrete broke off without leaving any visible damage to the car. Not that I’m recommending being careless, but in the odd case that something happens you should be fine.

Maintenance
The main question would be around charging. I’ve installed the AC wall charger at home, and as the meter was very close to the charging point there wasn’t too much expense on the high capacity cable. The car has completed first free service and there was no expense. Most importantly, unlike each of my earlier cars (Micra, Swift, XUV500), there was no minor complaints that needed me to visit the service center. The car continues to be perfect, as it was on the day of delivery (absolutely no rattles or unknown sounds). Continuing on the topic of charging, the pattern I’ve followed has been charging overnight. Earlier I used to set maximum charging current that required 6 hours for a full charge. However, I now use only minimum current and that increases the charging time to 8 hours. The reason for this is that, the maximum load of my meter is 5 KW and the maximum current reaches 7 KW at times. The charger was initially set up on the single phase line, but the overload caused the line to blow up a couple of times. Subsequently, I’ve moved it to the 3 phase line and since then it’s been perfect. Lesson learned, the charger definitely needs 3 phase line to work without problems. But other than this, there’ve been no other issues. Based on current utilization, I need to charge twice a week. I follow a 20% limit rule and never let the charge get lower. If you're someone who is very clear about your fueling approach and have never gotten stuck with an empty tank (like me), then you'll not have any problems adjusting to the EV charging method, it'll very soon become second nature.

The only complaint would be the need to use a smart card to begin the charging after plugging in. In case you are charging overnight and there's a power cut, then the charging is interrupted until you go back and swipe again. However, this has happened so rarely that it's not too much of an issue.
Portable charger has been provided, and this also allows you to change the level of charging current. But unfortunately, I've not yet been able to use it. Next year, when offices reopen I plan to use it for free charging. Will share an update when that happens.

The TPMS is a life saver. The recommended pressure is 36 psi, and as long as the pressure is above 30 psi the sensor doesn’t switch on. But once the pressure goes below 30 psi, then until the pressure is again above 36 psi the sensor will stay on. The display at the center console also indicates which tyre has low pressure. The alert is pretty aggressive and will make a loud beep and not go away until the recommended pressure is reached. The spare wheel is a space-saver and has maximum speed rating of 80 kmph. The overall tyre change process is really easy and can be completed in less than 10 minutes. Though considering the recent concerns on the tyre shortage in India, I’m slightly worried. But, hopefully by the time my tyres are due for a change this problem has been resolved. As reviews have pointed out, the grip is easily lost when driving spiritedly. But otherwise, the tyres are good, and silent under most circumstances. Though I've not personally used it extensively, you can set the regen to level zero and coast for a long distance with no power needed. The tyres live upto the low rolling resistance claim. They also brake effectively, under normal and emergency situations.

Exteriors, Interiors and Gizmos
Exteriors are the best part of the car. I'll start from the rear. The raised stance gives it an aggressive appearance and the unique split lamps are great to look at. The brake lights and rear lamps are both LED and are at the top. The indicators, reversing lamps and rear fog lamps are at the lower cluster. Clean look, with just the Kona and electric badges. The rear camera is neatly integrated.

The sides are clean, but the aggressive profile is already becoming clearly only an illusion. The car is clearly not an SUV despite the cladding and roof rails. The unique alloys are good looking and mix well with the overall electric aesthetic.

And finally the front. It's the best part about this car and also the worst and that's why I've reserved it for the last. The awesome DRL and LED headlamps are a treat to look at whether in the morning or night. The no grill look takes some getting used, but is the best part of the car. Clearly sets it apart as an EV. The charging ports are neatly hidden under the right side of the covered grill. But, for all its futuristic looks there's one thing the front can't hide, and that's what's the worst part of the car. Just one look at the low slung front end and it's clear this is no SUV. If you can come to terms with that, then you're ready to go to the next part.

No doubts on who’s a real SUV.


The inside is where you’ll be spending a lot of time in the car and this is a good place to be for the driver. The view is similar to any other hatchback (SUV it’s not). The steering is leather wrapped and maybe a tad too small, but you get used to it. Most of the required shortcuts are available on the steering mounted controls. If you’ve plugged in apple CarPlay, then Siri is also available from a dedicated button on the steering and you wouldn’t need to take your eyes off the road for managing the touchscreen.


The display is clean and bright. Only when the sun is directly shining on the console does the visibility get impacted, else all required information is clearly visible. I’ve intentionally shared pics that were captured under glare to show its brightness and ease of use under most conditions.

Driver information display changes based on the drive mode, comfort mode is what’s my favorite. Range is at the center, speed is through a typical dial, battery level is at the right. Power consumption replaces the erstwhile rpm dial and is a vertical bar on the left. Stay close to the center and you’re good. Go much above and your consumption will take a hit. Go below, and you’re regenerating energy. Happens only for short stretches, but is very strong during braking.

Eco mode replaces range with speed in the center. The dial is now showing power consumption. What’s really cool is the way it shows how many meters have been added to the range because if regen. This is something that should be shown across modes. The best I’ve ever managed is a couple of kms.

Sport mode is really the best looking display, with everything designed like a sports car display. This is also the only mode where information also changes with the rapidness of a sports car. But, as I’ve said earlier despite the inherent fun this is the least used mode. Combination of range consciousness and complaints from passengers have made it a distant third. On the occasions I’ve used it though, consumption averages 14-15 KWH/100kms. The range reduced by almost 5-10 kms.

But it’s not really needed in the city, comfort has the performance needed for completing most maneuvers. Best use of sport mode, if you’re at the signals and have annoying bikers gunning their engines to be first out of the signals. The sport mode will leave most (except maybe super bikes) for dead. Be careful though, the 80 kmph speed warning will chime really quick. Also, I’m not recommending overspeeding. Always follow rules and drive according to the conditions of the road. The problem with the sport mode is that it gives you too much speed for safe use in the city. The erratic nature of city traffic means you’ll be going too fast for emergency moves. This is why I’ve not used it too much.

The driver information system lets you choose what information you want to see on the right side of the display. There are multiple display options and it should be easy to find something for everyone. I personally use the trip information, displaying range consumption and duration of trip. The TPMS menu is also here and can be viewed after you’ve driven for a bit. The user customization menu however can only be seen when the car is stopped. Lots of cool options here, such as setting how the car should react when the key is near the car. Like opening the side mirrors. You can also select what should trigger the auto lock, when the drive mode is selected or when you reach 20kmph. Many other such nice options here. Each makes the car specific to you.

The drive selection mode is a very unusual switch model, but once you use it you realize it’s very intuitive. The positioning is very comfortable and switch size is comfortable for all sizes of hands. The handbrake switch is also below the drive mode switches. Very easy to use, pull up for engaging the brake and push down for disengaging. Though I’m sure you’ll never need to use the disengage, when you tap the accelerator the handbrake is auto disengaged. This is a very smart option, and soon you’ll be wondering how it was done in any other way. The seat ventilation options, drive mode options, auto hold are located at the bottom. There’s also a couple of blank switches, making you wonder what you’re missing out on. When Auto hold mode is enabled, the default creep forward in drive mode is disabled and you’ll need to tap the accelerator to move forward. However, I rarely felt the need for it. The handbrake is something I use very often, also when you use the regen to stop the car then it doesn’t move again until acceleration input is provided (very convenient, you’ll understand when you use).


The ICE is a touchscreen, which compared to today’s monster sizes may seem a bit small. But it’s perfect for my liking, and is bright enough under all conditions. Has all the needed info and is very responsive too. Reverse camera view is integrated into the ICE, and music volume is auto lowered when reverse is engaged.


The EV menu can only be accessed only when the car is completely on and not in ignition mode. This allows you to customize charging currents and charging times. The charging times is a feature that allows you to set specific hours when the car should be charged, and the charging is auto turned off out of these hours. Useful where the current cost varies by hours, haven’t used it much myself. The charging current allows you to set the consumption charge. I’ve set it to minimum, as this means usage of 4 KW, which is safe for my 5 KW power line. The highest current mode needs at least 7 KW, and after a couple of line blowouts I’m happy to stay at lowest. The difference is only a couple of hours anyway.

Useful switches for AC are provided below the touchscreen. AC is comfortable and cools effectively, but isn’t a chiller. No complaints from my end as this means I don’t need to constantly fiddle with the ac. My XUV AC is very cool and even at 24 degrees sometimes it gets too cool and I need to adjust the temperature to make myself comfortable. This means you adjust the ac at-least 3-4 times every trip. I’ve never needed to bother with adjusting ac here, just set the temperature and drive. If your better half complains about the ac, just go to the driver only mode. This keeps only the driver side vents active and also adds about 2-3 kms to the range. The only downside being that there’re no rear vents, which means on hot days there’ll be complaints from any rear seat passengers till the car cools down.

The usb, aux and wireless charging are cleverly concealed under a hatch. If you forget a phone in the wireless charger, then there is an audible alert in the driver display with the message that phone is in the charger. Sound quality is good enough for me, but I’m not an audiophile to judge its merits in comparison to the newer speakers from Bose and Harman in competitors.


There’re two lamps near the sunroof controls and one in the center of the roof beyond the sun roof. They provide good interior illumination.


The LED headlamps are very cool to look at, and have a wide throw. But they’re not long enough and you will need high beam if you’re on the highway. Cornering lamps are halogen and it’s easy to tell when they’re on due to the sheer contrast with the LED throw.

The lower dash is wide enough to store iPads and has two slots. One for USB and one a lighter port. There is a storage compartment under the hand rest. It’s deep enough to store small water bottles or tetra packs, but it’s not cooled. The glove box is relatively small, and can only hold a few documents but it's not too small that you'll complain. The front doors can hold 1 liter water bottles, but the rear doors can only do 500 ml.


I’ve only been in the rear seats when cleaning the car or setting up the child seats. But it's not terrible to be for a short while. However, taller passenger will be requesting front passengers to adjust the seat position so that they can be comfortable. Shorter passengers, like my kids or my mom don't complain though. But, the seats are really narrow and it's best used as a 4 seater. Longer drives with taller passengers will also generate complaints due to the raised floor. The harsh ride is felt more acutely at the rear seats, as per my family members. My wife has refused to ever sit in the rear seats after one relatively bad experience. But, it's not truly terrible. I've had a pregnant colleague who had the misfortune of traveling with me in both the XUV and this car (pre-COVID days), both of the occasions in the rear seat. She was very clear that she preferred the Kona over the XUV, which had a bouncy ride. So, that's that. I'm never going in the rear myself, so third hand opinions will have to do. Rear ac vents and charging points are missing.

The most useless feature, sunroof. It’s cool for showing off, but except for the night drives and early morning drives it’s not useful at all. Even the cover being open increases brightness and heat in the cabin, and I’ve kept it mostly closed. Only used with the cover open during early morning drives to increase the brightness in the cabin.

What’s conspicuous by its absence is the Hyundai Blue Link. Now, I don’t know if I would’ve actually used it, but it hurts when cars that cost a third get it. Big miss from the optics perspective. I've shared this feedback with Hyundai directly on multiple occasions. Recently, some one from the dealers office took my details for a supposed Blue Link update, but there's been confirmation from anyone else since. Fingers crossed, I'll post an update if I ever get the BlueLink update.

Experience
Best part of the ownership experience, is the looks you get from the others on the road. Curious people asked me about the car at signals (pre-covid times). I’ve even been photographed from following cars. The attention is even better at night, the LED DRLs and LED Headlamps just improve the appeal of this car. The looks of the car are perfect, and this was a very important factor in overlooking the MG ZS. The front passenger will love the car, there’s enough room and the ventilated seats only add to the experience. The only downside is the lack of electric seat adjustment for the passenger. Driver seats are electrically adjustable. Rear seats aren't too bad, but not a good place for taller passengers. However, the car is intended to be primarily used only for personal trips (maximum 3 people). I have retained my XUV for the times that would need all of the family to go out. The trunk is not too big, but there’s enough space for multiple shopping bags. The instant acceleration is a very nice party trick to show off the car, but you need to be cautious. Passengers with motion sickness have complained of nausea and headaches when they experienced acceleration from stand still in the sport mode for the first time. I tried it once on the better half and the reaction was very strong (totally worth in my opinion).

But how does it function in its basic purpose as a car? Very good I should say. The car is so agile to make driving something you look forward to and the compact size means it’s not a pain in the traffic or narrow roads. Trips that I’ve avoided before because of the journey time are now looked forward to. Case in point, shopping errands where I’m only on driver duty. Also, the family also will ask you for lifts much more often. Recently, dad had to go to the other end of the city on work and didn’t want to take his car due to a lack of parking. Cabs were out of the question due to Covid concerns. I dropped him, returned home, went back to pick him up. Total distance of 100 kms, still costs less than an one way trip in a cab. I’ve received many more such requests since. Kids bored at home, get them in the car and take them in a long drive, costs the same as a chocolate bar. Such is the utility and comfort everyone has with this car, that the two wheeler which was retained only for the purpose of running small errands has been unused for months now.

But the best part about this car is how it makes you a better driver. Difficult to believe, but hear me out. Imagine you’re in a diesel car, and have found the sweet spot of power and speed. Suddenly, someone cuts across you and you lose that perfect harmony you had. Your reaction is irritation and then you either try to overtake the offender or speed up to find the sweet spot again. How many times have we gunned our engines when we encounter a free road after overcoming a horrible bit of traffic? Now imagine the same thing in an EV. There’s nothing to search for, tap the accelerator and you’re back at your old pace again. I’ve not experienced road rage in the last few months at all. In heavy traffic or empty roads, the experience is exactly the same. If you’re range conscious like me, then in fact to achieve that good consumption score you drive more sedately and use regen. This means, even when presented with the opportunity to drive fast I’ve preferred to go slower to ensure I get a single digit consumption score. Mind you, it’s not because I’m worried of the current bills. I just want to see how low I can take the score. And as mentioned before every time you do something against this, the reaction from the car is instant and your score just stares back at you once you reach your destination. Silently shaming you for giving into temptation.

The only downside is the lack of special treatment from Hyundai. Mahindra really pampered me with the Purple Club program, there’s no such thing at Hyundai. Even for buying a halo product. Of course, there are dedicated EV service experts who are available to answer any query. And of course, there’ve been multiple follow ups from Hyundai and the dealer for support. Just think that Hyundai is missing a trick here by not formally grouping this under an exclusive program. But I’m probably nitpicking here, as the experience of the car itself has been truly awesome so far.

Final Words
The recent surge in fuel prices in any other time, would have made me really worried. But, thanks to the Kona I’ve not been worried at all. Plus, I’ve also installed solar panels at my home and soon should also further reduce the electricity bills. Those of you on the line about EV vs IC, don’t hesitate to make the jump. It won’t be a long distance traveller, but for those using it primarily for city commutes nothing really beats the utility and simplicity of an EV.

Financially, the initial payment will be high. But factor in the lack of fuel expenses, service costs and also the tax deduction on the EV car loan interest, then it actually costs lower to use than my earlier car (XUV 500). Monthly expenses are around 30,000 Rs maximum (inclusive of the electricity expenses). This should go lower once the solar panels are up and running. It has been as simple as using my phone. I’ve been very good at managing my phone charge through the day, never needing to charge it through the day. That has helped instill the discipline to manage the charge of the car. Plus, I’ve got charging facilities at office. Once we are able to return to offices, I wouldn’t even need to charge at home. I can charge for free and make my running expenses closer to zero. This outlook is something else altogether. In the last 10 years of owning cars, I’ve had to factor in not just the car EMI but also the running costs like fuel and service expenses. Since purchasing this, I’ve had so much additional money unused that I’ve given into temptation and splurged on other wants. Definitely need to bring this into control. Skeptics might add that the lockdown would have anyway allowed this to be saved, but I would say that I’ve continued to use the car at pre-lockdown levels after the unlock and I’ve still managed to save money. I took the XUV for a service recently, and the service bill was like a dagger through the heart.

But there’s one big difference between this car and an IC that I’ve not touched upon so far. It’s the lack of a soul. Every petrol or diesel car, has soul. An unique identity that makes it yours. It tells you when it wants to be driven fast, when you’re going too fast. It tells when you make mistakes like choose the wrong gear or push it beyond its limits. Every repair hurts you. The bond you share with your car is emotional. This is why we name them and treat them as steeds. Anyone looking for that in an EV, steer away.

This is a soulless cold machine. Anyone can drive it, under any circumstance and the reactions would be exactly the same. There’s no feedback, no telling you that you’ve made a mistake or you need to do something. There’s no moods, no increased clatter on a cold morning or slightly spirited throttle response when it has just the right engine temperature. 100 out of 100 times, it will do what you tell it to do without any difference in behavior. And that’s not such a bad thing. I’ve two young kids at home, and between them and my work I’ve enough emotions to overwhelm me. I don’t need a car added to that list at this point of time. And for anyone else looking for that, EVs are the way to go. They’re the introverted adults to the loud obnoxious teenagers of diesel cars.

In closing, this car is very close to my heart. And I’ve always looked back with love and admiration whenever I’ve parked it. I’ve always changed cars every 3 years (lack of financial prudence and common sense). But, I’ve a feeling this might be a keeper (for a very long time).

Other things to note
Switch on the car, drive a bit, and switch off. Switch it on again, the range has mysteriously dropped by 2 kms. This happens every time and I’ve no clue as to why.
Temperature impacts the range by almost 10-15 kms. The sweet spot seems to around 24 degrees. That’s why you may see that the range magically increases in the evening after a hot day. Or increases after a cool night.
On occasions there is a Yellow light that glows on the logo. This is due to the smaller battery getting charged from the main battery. This is nothing to worry about.
I have completed one really long drive of 220 kms, I started the drive with 300 kms range, ended the trip with 95 kms of range. The consumption was 10.5KWH/100kms. It has definitely given me the confidence to take it on longer trips in the future when things are better. Switch off the ac and go into the eco mode, I’m sure we can cover atleast 380 kms under sedate driving.
The paint quality is not that great, have already started seeing swirl marks despite taking the best care.
Cleaning the car is a pain, there are various design elements at rear that are dust magnets and accumulators.

Attention to detail on the driver console is very good, the TPMS and door ajar indicators actually have the shape of the car. The same can’t be said of the ICE display. It shows a generic car indicating the drive modes.

I’ve recently also been given a complimentary Kona EV care program by Hyundai, this extends my road side assistance to 8 years and also gives me a free tire inflator kit.
Unintended side effect, becoming a geography expert. Did you ever observe which ends of the route were at a relatively higher level or which path requires more uphill drive than downhill? Well you’ll know thanks to the consumption figures on this car. Same route, one way (downhill) consumption is 8.5 KWH/100kms. Return journey (uphill) overall consumption is 11.4 KWH/100kms."

re: Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"Congratulations on this beauty! She's a real looker in this shade of blue. I've never been very fond of EVs (except the Teslas & Taycans) but your outlook has made me rethink.

Will I purchase an EV now? No.
Will I purchase one in upcoming years? Well, it's not easy to convince a die-hard petrolhead, but you might've just about done so!

Also, regarding why the charge drops on switching the car on & off. The reason is quite simple, actually. Think of the battery as a phone processor. When you open an app, use it and then shut it down, there is more load on the processor. Similarly, since the battery takes more effort to start the car again, the % might have an adverse effect."

"Thanks for the detailed ownership review of the Kona. Great read. EV is really an ideal vehicle for your usage (100+ km a day). It's good that we have 3 options now compared to nothing just over a year ago.

Quote:
The salesperson mentioned that the full charge would be about 70 units and a quick calculation confirmed that would mean about 300 Rs.
It must be a typo right. Full charge consumes approx. 40 units as the battery capacity is 39.2 KWh (1KWh = 1unit)."

"Congratulations !!

I am a firm believer of change and I see in next 5-7 years EVs adaption gonna increase.

I always say - ""Buying a car is only 1/3 of the Cost, rest 2/3 is maintaining it"" but I am sure EVs are gonna change it.

Its a matter of time with adaption, availability of charging docks and range is taken care inturn reducing the overall prices. My next car is definitely gonna be EV"

"Excellent review. I have neither your writing skills nor your patience, but you captured so many of my thoughts. There are all of ~350 of us Kona owners in India and it’s a very lonely existence in some ways.

One thing I didn’t see in your review was a reference to the recall and the BMS update. Did that leave you feeling nervous ? I’ve sort of come to terms with it now, but it reminds me that you and I are definitely early adopters and that there are implications that come with that.

Must be a typo, obviously the charger and the electronics will lose some energy as waste heat but it should not be very much, I would assume that the charger is at least 90% efficient.
It would be good if the OP can take actual measurements of units used during charging."

Thanks for your post! After having used EVs in Europe as my preferred mode of transport, I've always wondered how good it would be for Indian conditions considering our average speeds. The biggest enemy for an EV is speed, and in developed nations where highway cruising is at 100+ kmph on an average, the range is severely limited.

Not so in India, and I'm glad to know you're getting 300+ km on the Kona. Now only if the charging infrastructure in our country improves!

Re: Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"Congrats on the car bgt_titan. The Kona maybe expensive, but as you said, it is so much cheaper to run and maintain in the long run. Will make more sense as and when more charging points come up.

I found the Kona to have a harsh ride and low on space at the back, esp for a 25 lakh rupee car. Can be used in the city only. Yet to drive the ZS EV to see how it compares over the Kona. Glad you retained the XUV500 for the occasional highway runs.

Re: Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"Brilliant writeup and many congratulations for the ownership of a brilliant EV. It is such detailed reviews that have the potential to create converts from ICE to EVs.

I am sure with the manufacturing push and loads of marketing, EV adoption will increase a lot in the coming years. I am sure there are 1000s of users whose cars hardly ever travel more than 200 or 300km a day and many only use them for city. Thats the kind of public who can be best suited for EV adoptions for now.

Great review and thanks for such details on each aspect of the ownership. Looking at your pics, I presume you stay in a standalone house, where I think getting a charger fixed would not have been an issue. Wonder how people can manage in large apartment complexes.

The only concern I have with EVs on highways is that even after having dedicated charging stations on the way, the time it will take for your turn in case the charging station is full. Currently, a Bangalore to Hyderabad run (~550 kms) is not possible on an EV. But who knows, the tech and affordability can soon change. Looking forward to the adoption rates.

Till then will be hooked to your review to enjoy the experiences."

The recall was something of a furtive issue for Hyundai India. I wrote to the customer care multiple times and got no response. Of course, they finally reverted with the BMS and ECU updates in the last week. I’ve not yet driven extensively post the update. However, considering that the risk factor is very low I’m hopeful that it shouldn’t be a concern for us. Also, this is another reason for me to maintain lowest charging current in the assumption that higher charging currents are what could potentially have lead to the incidents globally.

Sorry for barrage of questions.
Hyundai is providing 8 years or 160,000 kms warranty. Would it be needed, depends on the technology at the time of replacement. If yes, the costs should be lower than they’re today due to improvement in battery tech. I am not sure of what would be the exact figure. But, degradation would happen gradually and you’ll see lower ranges but the car would continue to be useful. If I could give an analogy, it would be similar to iPhones that just lose battery life, but not like the erstwhile Nokia phones which had swollen batteries that would stop functioning.

Re: Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"Congrats on your Kona EV. Fantastic review, very well written.

Just like everyone, I was always curious about the latest EVs and their real time ownership reports, thoroughly enjoyed reading your review. While it gives the highest range of all EVs in today's Indian market, my only complain about the Kona is it's looks, for 26 lakhs on road, Hyundai should have given a Creta looking EV instead of an i20 elite looking EV, this is the first thing I thought when I saw the car's scoop and launch pictures, remembered it again after seeing your Kona along with your XUV 5OO. Anyway, glad that you adapted yourself from XUV to Kona, generally SUV lovers / owners don't like the low seating position and can't leave SUV characteristics, but on an economical point of view and for your 120 kms + daily running EV makes sense and Kona is a perfect option, also good call on Solar panels installation, can you please share the cost of solar panels installation and the output it provides? Enjoy your ride.

I think I've seen your car en-route to Sainikpuri via Ramakrishna puram bridge about 2 months back, since this is a rare car I'm guessing it might be you."

I do want to ask you though - why would you say Monthly expenses are around Rs. 30,000? I do not have solar panels. So, I am drawing power from the state electricity board using my 3-phase connection. But barring the electricity costs for charging the vehicle, the vehicle itself does not have any monthly expenses.

Apologies, I should’ve made that clear. The 30,000 is including the EMI I’m paying for the car.

I meant to contrast that with 45-50k I was paying for the XUV(EMI + fuel + ORR tolls). And of course the service once every 4-5 months that would set you back 10-15k on average, which keeps inching higher every time the XUV goes to the service center. So, a total spend of probably 50k on XUV every month."

Some quick updates:
Keeping your Loan EMI aside, the service interval is once a year or 10,000 kms whichever is first. Excepting for the very first one - this is done after about 45 to 60 days after purchase. It's more like a checkup, than servicing.

The servicing costs per year, should not cost you more than 2k to 3k a year. It doesn't have any moving parts. Probably they may change the AirConditioning filter / fluid etc....Brake pads would be more like once in 2 odd years, but if you use the left paddle shift in a judgemental fashion, you'd probably rely less on brakes, thereby extending the life of your brake pads.

So, overall - yearly servicing costs should not be much at all. These are all information I got from my sales man and service advisor as well. The yearly maintenance is also one major selling factor for Kona EV!!

Hope this helps."

Re: Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"Great write up!! Though you did mention your math I do feel that Kona is still quite overpriced. Nexon EV at 15 lakhs could have added that extra range for maybe 3 or 4 lakhs more. But seems like TATA wanted to price it reasonably which is a smart move.

Also, I can't help but notice design elements similar to Grand i10 NIOS. The steering and central A/C vents look quite similar."

Re: Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"Great review! Your review really describes why range anxiety in EVs is overrated for 95% of the population.

Two factors can lead to mass adoption:
1. Good EVs (with >=350km real-world range) at INR 15 lakhs
2. Reliable charging in highways

If the government give people INR 1-1.5 lakh in tax credits (EV makers get excise benefits) and raises the price of fuel, people will quickly adopt EVs."

Re: Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"Looking at the all the posts, I can't help but feel that for the EV's to take off, we need highway infrastructure. There is no point in building City EV Infrastructure. Because all the 3 EV's in market right now have sufficient range to do say 200 kms. So, even if a person does 200 kms (which is a rare thing to do, especially city driving), they still can come home and charge at home overnight.

So, City EV infrastructure is not necessarily needed too much. We need more highway infrastructure. Govt should provide subsidies and encourage entrepreneurs & start-ups to put up atleast 2 fast chargers at every highway petrol pump.

If the Highway EV infrastructure develops, EV sales will take off immediately.!!!"

Stock tyres meet the needs for my driving style. They can give up under hard acceleration, but are good the rest of the time. Have used them on semi rough roads, and they haven’t been damaged or punctured. They also live up to their low rolling resistance specs.

Boot space is smaller than what you’d expect from a CSUV, but it’s good enough to carry monthly groceries for a small family. Best it can do would be a large suitcase. I’m sharing an image for reference. The bag on the right is the carrying case for the portable charger.

That is a misconception. Almost everyone will take at least two to three breaks in an eight to ten hour drive. All you have to do is plan to have you lunch and tea or coffee at a place with a charger and you are all set. If you drive 200 kms and take a break, you would have around 40 to 50% range left. You can top it up to 90% or above at a fast charger while you go have lunch for 45 minutes. Then do another 30 minute top up while you stop for some tea or coffee and you are all set.

Even though you are generally correct, there are a lot of people in the cities who don’t have a parking space. They might have to park on a street or even in their apartment parking but it might be too far away from their home to charge the vehicle. So for these people, having convenient charging stations around the city would be very useful. In addition, there are all kinds of electric vehicles. Many like the eVerito and Tiago provide barely 80 kms range. Many people could buy them as they are cheaper if they had a place to charge while they work or shop."

"Thank you for this detailed review on the Hyundai Kona Electric. Your review puts a lot of professional reviews to shame. I have a few questions about the Kona though and I hope you can answer them for me.

1. You write that your Kona gives you an average of 330km. Is this with a 100% charge? What are your typical speeds?
2. From what I understand, you have a 240V EVSE. What current (amperes) do you charge at? I read that you usually charge at 5KW but I am not sure how to convert it to amperes.
3. What is the difference in current draw between a single phase and three phase electric supply for your EVSE?

Thanks again for the review."

3. What is the difference in current draw between a single phase and three phase electric supply for your EVSE?

Thanks again for the review.
1. Yes, with a full charge of 100%. Average speeds of 40-60 kmph in the city traffic. The consumption for a particular drive is lowered if I go higher than 80 kmph, but as long as overall consumption remains less than 13 KWH/100kms, you’ll get the full range of 330-340kms.
2. This is probably a very technical question, and I doubt I am capable of answering it completely. But, I’m giving it a shot and apologies if I get it wrong. I’ve tried this on an online converter for KW to Amps. Assuming 3 phase current for 240 V, line to line voltage and power factor of .96 the load would be ~10 Amps.
3. No difference in the current draw, the Kona onboard system indicated loads of 4.0KW for slower charging and 7.0KW for fastest charging in both cases. However, the contracted load of the connection itself was different. It’s 1.0KW for the single phase and 5.0KW for three phase. This was perhaps the reason the line burnt out a couple of times on the single phase. No such issues on the three phase, but even then I take care not to run any other heavy appliances such as geyser or AC on the 3 phase line when charging (to avoid overload).

I’m also attaching the tech specs of the wall charger installed at my home. Hopefully, this helps more than my amateur attempt earlier."

Re: Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"I’ve been reading about the errors being seen in the other Kona EVs, and would like to update that I’m experiencing no such issues. Hyundai has updated my BMS (Battery Management System) and ECU. While I wouldn’t say that I’ve driven extensively since then, but have completed ~500 Kms. I’ve charged the car twice in that period and can confirm that there are no issues I’ve experienced. The car continues to perform as excellently as before. The only change is that, as expected after an update, the range has come down from the original 350 Kms. But it is going back up after each charging cycle and has already reached 310 Kms, should go to the full 350 after the next 2/3 charging cycles.

Regarding errors faced by the others, it is truly unfortunate that this is happening. But it is the outcome of caution on the part of the manufacturer. The downtime is significant for the affected cars, but the end outcome is that you’re getting a new battery and a much safer car. I personally believe that this is the risk of being an early adopter. But it is also similar to risk we take with other new products. There are niggles that we hear of in new products such as Harrier and Seltos. It’s just that due to the underlying technology in EVs, the downtime is high for replacement. Hopefully, once these are resolved there shouldn’t be any further issues with the cars.

Hopefully, there’s not too much negativity right now around the car for users to be interested in further details about my ownership. I was requested to post interiors pictures, and I couldn’t do it earlier due to a hectic work week. Have managed to find time to update it now.

The front seats are low set, as expected in a hatchback. There’s good legroom and headroom for both front seats. The central console and armrest are wide and gives enough room for both the driver and passenger.


The rear seats are set slightly higher than the front seats, and are wide enough for two passengers. The transmission tunnel eats into the legroom for the middle passenger, and it is definitely recommended to have only two rear passengers.


Height difference between the front seats and rear seats is visible in the below picture.


The floor height is much higher for the rear seats than the front seats. I’ve used a basketball and football to provide a visual aid for reference. You can see that the smaller football is still appearing higher than the basketball on the floor of the rear seats.



I am a six-footer, and I’ll use my own legs for reference to the space available in the rear seats.

This is the right rear seat, behind the driver seat set to my preferred position. I drive in a relaxed seating position, and don’t push the front seat fully back. Probably around 80% of the maximum distance. Still, there isn’t much space in the rear seat. My knees are in contact with the rear of the front seat. Because of the ventilated front seats, the back is hard plastic and contact is not comfortable. Definitely not my preferred seat if I were forced to sit in the rear. I’ve used if for the child seats primarily.


Left rear seat, there’s almost 2 cms of space between the back of the front seat and my knees. Much more comfortable in comparison to the right rear seat. The front seat is set to my preference and has extended about 80% of the maximum.

With the front seats moved ahead a bit, there’s much more leg room. This is my wife’s preferred seating position, and provides comfort for both front passenger and rear passenger. This probably can be the reference for the average leg room.


However, you will continue to sit in a legs up position, and this is definitely not comfortable over longer distances for taller people. As referenced earlier, this is not a problem for shorter people such as my mother or wife. However, the hard suspension will make things a little more uncomfortable on bad roads. The only saving grace is the really wide arm rest that is both comfortable and wide enough to ensure you don’t rub arms with neighbors sharing the rear seat.


P.S. Please ignore the general untidy state of the car. Those with kids would agree that it is difficult to keep it very clean despite our best efforts. I’m not comfortable giving it outside for cleaning."

Thanks for the detailed answer and the spec sheet. I guess your EVSE will well suited. At the max 33 amps and 230 volts, you get a charge rate of 7.59kW. I believe the Kona has a max charge rate of 7.68kW on AC. Are you able to control the charge rate from the car or do you do it from the charger?

Finally, how does using the AC affect the range? In other words, how much does your kWh/100km drop with AC use. Thanks again."

The charging rate is controlled from the EV menu on the ICE in the car, you can between maximum (7.0KW), medium (5.5-6.0KW) or minimum (4.0KW). Except a reset button, there’s no other options on the charger itself.

I’ve never driven with the AC off, but turning off the AC provides an instant range boost of 15-20 KMS. I’m attaching the pictures of a typical city drive with climate control set to 24 degrees and ventilated seats switched on at medium blower. This indicates that AC consumes 16% of the battery usage. Since this is on a winter morning, maybe the load on the AC was not too high. If we’re testing in summer we can assume this may go up to 25%. Hope this helps."

I like that the displays are colorful on the Kona unlike my Niro.

On the Niro, I do not have a spare tire. Instead Kia gives a can of tire sealant and a tire inflator. One of my friends bought a spare tire for a Niro PHEV and installed it in his vehicle to overcome this.

Kia and Hyundai being essentially the same company, do you have a full spare tire or do you have a joke of a tire inflator in your Kona?"

We get an emergency spare tyre, with the specs T135/80 D17. I don’t think tyre inflators and sealants would work for India. The spare tyre is given its own section in the boot under the base and doesn’t occupy the actual boot space. Very similar to other hatchbacks."
Re: Hyundai Kona EV : Ownership Review
"One Year Later -

So, the car has clocked 14k kms as of end October. After only 5k in the first 10 months, I’m happy that the usage has increased to 9k in the subsequent 11 months. So, with over 20 months of having lived the electric life, there are many things I’ve learned. I’ll share them here I hopes of addressing some of the major myths and concerns around EVs.

Highs - No fuel expenses, no worry about rising fuel costs, silky smooth drive, happiness about owning a unique car, zero maintenance costs.

Lows - Batterygate (have to be honest that I was worried for a bit, even though my car wasn’t one of the affected), unique car (worry about future support) and … that’s pretty much it. No other concerns with the car.

Uglies - Animal love - Street dogs in my neighborhood have taken a love to the car and have ripped to shreds my car covers on 3 different occasions. Buying car covers is the highest expense I’ve incurred on the car so far. They’ve also left some ugly scratches on the lower bumper.

Now on to the details. I wanted to share my ownership experience on the following topics that are always discussed when considering an EV.
Range
Cost / expensive
Charging concerns
Unsafe / dangerous tech
Battery degradation
Weather conditions
Driving feel
For whom is it a perfect fit

1. Range concerns - What you see is what you get. I’m not sure of other cars, but the Kona is very reliable in terms of what you see in the range display. I’ve always got upwards of 300 kms for every full charge. There are regular BMS (Battery management system) updates from Hyundai, and the service center folks come home to update the car. After each update, the range drops by 30-40 kms, but after a couple of cycles of charging it returns to the full limit. The maximum range I’ve seen on the car with full charge is 343 kms. It is of course dependent on the weather conditions, and I will touch upon this later in the post.

The other part of range discussion is very subjective. What I share is purely my opinion, and others can disagree. I believe 300 kms is a sweet spot for those who use the car exclusively in the city. It sufficient enough to serve you for over 3-4 days city usage for things like office visits, shopping, dropping kids to school and so on. As of now, I’ve needed to charge my car only once a week. The charging process itself is very easy, and hence even if I were to increase my usage in the near future, I am happy with charging my car overnight. I will address charging later in this post.

Another important learning is that for shorter trips (typically <5kms or less than 10-15 minutes), you consume more charge as the AC and other auxiliary power consumption is higher. So you consume range higher than the actual distance of your trip. Not to worry, if you are going on a slightly longer trip (>10 kms or more than 30 minutes), the re-gen and power consumption averages kick in and you can actually recover some of the lost range.

2. Cost / Expensive - The other point that I’d like to address upfront is the cost aspect. Yes, EVs are expensive. But, I believe it is actually easier to own an EV of higher segment than a ICE car of the target segment. Let me elucidate, if our budget is 30,000 in EMIs - we are looking at cars in the budget range of approximately 20 lakhs. But, there are additional costs that we have to factor in when buying ICE cars such as fuel expenses and maintenance. The maintenance cost for my car since I’ve owned it is zero. Even disregarding the low running due to lockdowns, I’m sure that there aren’t too many maintenance expenses waiting for me in the future. Fuel expenses are the most variable costs here. They’ve been sky-rocketing in the recent past, you can appreciate the savings in fuel expenses. The charging costs are negligible in comparison to the fuel expenses. I’ve not received more than 2,000 in additional electric utility bills in the last year (even in the months when I’ve charged my car every 3-4 days in a week). Yes, there are predictions of increasing the electricity slabs, but even then it will be very economical in comparison to fuel expenses. Of course, in my own personal case I’ve also purchases solar panels so I receive additional benefit for electricity expenses. So, any one looking for cars in 10 lakhs budget range can comfortably stretch their budget and get an Nexon EV (15 lakhs approx.). Similar, arithmetic for higher budgets.

3. Charging concerns - This is something that has been receiving lot of attention in the media recently. Even our own forum had a discussion on how to set up in older apartments. Let me emphatically say that this is the most important thing to be considered when buying an EV. I’d originally installed the home charger (peak 7.2 KW) on a single phase 1 KW line. I expressed my doubts to the technician who had installed it in my home, but he said it is fine and he has installed it other places as well in a similar fashion. As mentioned in my initial post, I’ve suffered line burnouts twice when the car was charging. After these incidents, I’ve moved the charger to a 3 phase 5 KW line. I’ve also been using the slowest charging load (~4KW) and after these precautions have never experienced any concerns. Also, to be on the safer side I don’t use any other heavy load electricals such as geyser, ac or washing machine at the time that the car is being charged. My recommendation, before buying an EV we definitely need to upgrade our home electrical network to atleast 5 KW 3 phase line. Anything less, and there will be periodic electricity outages or fuse blowouts. Of course, the charger itself or the car have never experienced any problems because of these incidents. Now onto the actual question of charging - it is very stable if all the above conditions have been met. The time to charge is very accurate, and the system can also handle interruptions very well. The home charger provided by Hyundai needs us to swipe a card to start the charging. In case there is a power cut, and power returns within a hour or so then the charging automatically resumes. You don’t need to swipe the card again. My parking is semi-covered and there is a possibility for some water splashing on the car when it rains. I’ve charged during these times as well and haven’t experienced any problems. Of course, I’ve also added my own safety net of using my son’s kids umbrella over the charging port for additional protection. Once the charging is initiated, then the cable can be unplugged after unlocking the car or switching off the power supply. Else, the charging cable is locked onto the port. Good safety feature in my opinion. Of course, you need to establish your rhythms around charging. Once you’ve done that, you never need to worry about range. Actually, more than the range of the car you need to pay more attention to your charging habits. Unlike ICE cars, EVs aren’t so forgiving of mistakes in planning. If you need higher charge for a longer trip, don’t forget to charge up. This planning comes very naturally to me, and hence I’ve never really had any concerns with the range. If this isn’t your strength, then EVs are not going to be your cup of tea.

4. Unsafe / dangerous tech - This one comes with the biggest caveat. The tech isn’t unsafe or dangerous only if you’re buying from established players. I’ve seen the videos of electric scooters catching fires and other EV cars also catching fires. These incidents are very few, but definitely concerning if the tech we’ve purchased is fundamentally unsafe. Kona battery concerns are very well known, and company has also issued a recall. There are similar recalls for GM in the US. I believe that these should show that the companies are serious about safety and they are actually addressing the concerns. These are concerns that you get with any tech in it’s early stage mass adoption, but the incidents are very few. In my own personal use case, I’ve not experienced any concerns. I’ve had kids playing on the roof of the car while it was on charge and there were no concerns of electrocution / shock. As long as you don’t start exploring the innards of the car you should be fine. The car also has a helpful yellow light that turns on in the charging indicator that tells you that the secondary battery is being charged from the primary battery pack and we shouldn’t be touching anything we shouldn’t be near in the insides of the car. Otherwise, the tech itself is very safe. For a layman who is only concerned with getting in the car and driving - it works like a charm. No breakdowns, no sudden changes in range, no malfunctions. Everything works like it is expected to.

5. Battery Degradation - A lot of people factor in the cost of the battery when they talk about the cost of EV. That is unrealistic. Modern batteries degrade over an extended period of time. In my own personal experience, I’ve not yet experienced any change in range. Of course it is too soon to expect a major change, but that is the point. In over 20 months of ownership there’s been no degradation of battery life. Also, my charging habits means that I’ve probably completed less than 100 cycles. Batteries are rated for 1000 cycles at the very least. The range remains the same as it was when I bought the car, and the charging times are also the same. On the plus point, Hyundai is going to replace the battery soon, which means that for me personally I don’t expect any concerns within the next 5 years in the very least.

6. Weather conditions - Another factor that not many consider is the impact of weather conditions on the range. Batteries love certain weather conditions. The sweet spot from my experience is a temperature range of 20-30 degrees Celsius. If the weather gets hotter or colder, then the range is impacted. But not significantly. Only in the summer when temperatures exceed 40 degrees, do you see an impact of ~20 kms reduction in range. Of course, some of it could also be the AC working extra hard and therefore consuming more charge. In either case, for general weather conditions in Hyderabad (where I live), there is minimal impact of weather on the range. Another important personal lesson, is the assumption that if you turn off the AC then you get an additional 15-20 kms of range. That is true when you have just switched on the car, and there is a higher load on the AC. After a day long usage, when the car interior temperature is pretty much aligned with the external temperature, then turning off the AC doesn’t really do much for the range. At best it adds 5 kms. This was a trip when we had completed ~250 kms in a single day, and it was at the time that the charging was limited to 90% due to a BMS update. I tried switching off the AC to increase the range towards the end of the day, and still had only a 5 kms increase in range.

7. Driving feel - There’s so much said about this already, that I won’t spend too much time here. But, this is something that is so good, you’re actually spoilt by it. The silence in the cabin is almost unreal, and any other petrol / Diesel engine sounds very unrefined after this. The driving modes provide a significantly different experience, and you can choose modes based on your personal mood. I’ve mostly driven at comfort mode set to regen level 2. The regen limits your dependence on braking, and I’ve actually had to forcefully remind myself to brake when driving other cars that don’t have re-gen. Another thing that you get addicted to is the electric motor whine. It may not be to everyone’s liking, but when you are engaging in aggressive power consumption the electric whine is almost like you’re in a spaceship (like you’re at the helm of an x-wing for Star Wars fans). I really enjoy it, and the accompanying acceleration only serves to add to the feel. Have to add that it is deceptively quick and can be very dangerous if you try it in city traffic. I’ve always done this in empty roads on highways and never exceeded 120 kmph. For general city driving, it’s very relaxing and easy to use.

8. Final thoughts - Who’s an EV for - Anyone looking for an easy to own city car can should look for an EV. But, it comes with certain practical considerations. For all the benefits in terms of low running and maintenance cost, easy driving experience - there are many other limiting factors. These are the charging infrastructure support at home, adoption of charging habits. The range in itself wouldn’t ever concern you as long as you know the limitations and adapt to them accordingly. But, if you are someone who can’t adapt to these changes then an EV isn’t for you.
Another concern, or good thing depending on how you look at it. There’s no great updates to a Kona. Once you’ve used it and loved the EV experience, there’s really no great update in the market yet. The luxury EVs are at least 4 times the price and offer very similar range. What you get for the extra money (significantly more money) are luxury gizmos and badge value. Unfortunately, they’re also a pipe dream for some one with my current earnings (inflation is real even if I don’t buy fuel). There’s really no other car that you would want to upgrade to. Most of my car driving experience, I’ve started researching updates after a couple of years usage and changed cars after 3-4 years. But, this car might be the one that actually sticks with me long (I mean 5 years atleast). Of course, I do have my eye on Ioniq 5 and XC40 Recharge. If only they are priced reasonably, that’s probably hoping for too much.

My usage update -
The last year or so, the car has been primarily used for city usage exclusively. And it’s been perfect. But, in the recent few months I’ve started to explore longer trips with it. I’ve done a couple of trips to Bugga Falls (~220 kms trip) and Vikarabad (~270 kms trip) with other BHPians from Hyderabad. The car was able to keep up with other cars and also didn’t cause any range anxiety. Have been gingerly testing it’s limits. The next step would be to do an actual inter city trip with dependence on public charging infrastructure which I haven’t used at all so far. The plan is to visit Vizag in the near future. Ironically, will have to depend on the charging network being established by Tata and MG for doing this trip (where are you Hyundai?). Have to tip my hat to the efforts that Tata is putting towards EVs. Though also Hyundai is proactive in connect with the customers. I’ve had multiple updates from service advisors, relationship managers and customer care centers. There are also very frequent feedback calls, and they are putting an active effort to get customer feedback. What they are doing with it, I’ve no clue.

Completed the one year service, and again overall cost was zero. The only part that needed service was a hyper active right ORVM motor that kept opening the mirror multiple times at startup. It was replaced under warranty. No other concerns.

Dumb things I’ve done -
Was always wondering why the reversing camera quality seemed below par, realized that I never removed the plastic cover it comes with. Drastic improvement in quality once I removed this. Of course, also needs more regular cleaning as water and dirt smudges are more frequent now.
Put on a pair of jeans with zips at the rear and managed to damage the ventilated seats.
Misjudged the front end (coming from a XUV500, this is something I’ve had to adapt to), and scraped a wall at the service center.

Thank you for sticking through a very long write up. Unfortunately, don’t have too many pictures to share. Hope you enjoyed it, and happy to answer any questions you might have.

Closing note - just because I’ve an EV doesn’t mean I can say bye-bye to fuel pumps. I still need to visit them periodically for filling in air in the tyres.

Thank you very much for a detailed write up after having used your car extensively. I myself have booked the MG ZS EV and your points help ease some of my apprehensions regarding ownership of an EV.

Regarding the charger installation, MG does a site survey and asks for the last 3 months electricity bill copy before commencing work. I have a 3 phase 5 KW connection and they refused installation saying it is unsafe and that I need to enhance my allocated load. They said they need 6.8 KW over and above peak power used in any one phase. I am surprised Hyundai doesn't do the same, it will prevent blowouts and frankly be safer.

Please note that the MG does not have the capability to adjust charging current like the Kona.

Unfortunately houses in Tamilnadu (and I suspect most other states) are allocated at a maximum 5KW and so anyone installing a EV charger at home will have to apply for an enhancement which is usually a costly affair.

This is probably why Huyundai cuts corners because no potential customer will want to hear they have to go to the electricity department and enhance their allocated load to install a charger. Alternatively we can use the normal 16A plug and charge for close to 18 hours for a full charge. But that would mean giving up the 7.5 KW charger which is included in the price of the car and also having to really plan the charging well in advance if we need a full charge in the morning.

This is honestly a hidden cost when it comes to the MG ZS EV and the Kona. The Nexon is more India friendly and has no issues because it charges fully using a 16A plug point in just about 8 hours."

In India most of the EB's are running on a loss due to gross neglect and lack of proper maintenance. Today right from morning TNEB has been playing 'love me love me not' with even regular power supply. India and EV's is a disaster waiting to happen both for the customer and the Electricity boards. The EB's and their AE's charge huge bribes for even regular work on the transformer's in apartments, just imagine if you approach them say that you've bought a battery car costing 15-25 lakhs their eyes will go green in greed and they will make you bleed cash from all the orifices I don't mind dishing out Rs 100 and more for fossil fuel. India is not ready for EV's yet and not in the next ten years."

I vehemently disagree. Having driven a Kona Electric for more than a year and 50k km, I've never even once regretted switching to an EV. In fact, my family prefers Kona over other internal combustion car because of its refinement. We plan to keep it for 2 lakh km so making up the premium paid is not an issue. In city it is an absolute no brainer anyway, but even on highways between metros where charging infrastructure is picking up rapidly, it's just way cheaper than normal cars and far more enjoyable to drive. I didn't have to face any issues regarding getting a new meter for EV and overall installation of charger. I paid zero rupees in any sort of bribes.

Hyundai indeed does the survey. I was asked for details of load capacity and previous bills. I don't know about Tamil Nadu but my home meter has load capacity of 11kW so installing charger wasn't a big deal. Plus one can apply for special EV meter in Maharashtra (which I did) which has a rate of ₹6/kWh (excluding taxes) I had to pay around ₹11k as a security deposit and some ₹1.5k as installation charges. None of these include bribes, just to be clear. The only gripe is that I had to wait 2 whole months before I got the special meter. I'm charging my car on 7.5kW single phase supply and pay around ₹1/km in charging. Effective rate including taxes comes to around ₹7.5/kWh. Total I paid for installation of charger (laying down cable, labour, etc) was around ₹12k, for laying down wire from meter-box to my parking spot, apart from costs mentioned above for new meter installation. Considering I'll be keeping the car for at least 5 years and upgrading to another EV which can make use of exisiting charger, I don't think this cost is a burden at all. Plus it can be made up within 25k km of driving anyway (remember, ₹1/km). I plug in the car every night to top it up to 80% and charge it upto 100% whenever I'm going on a road trip so that isn't a problem to begin with either."

Sorry, I should’ve made it clearer. Actually, Hyundai does a home visit and check the electricity network. I had shared this in the initial post. They explain everything. But, it’s just that the final installation technician went with 1 phase line to reduce my electricity bill. And the blowouts also happened only when there were adverse conditions such as rain. Else, it was fine. Out of abundant caution, I decided to move to a 3 phase line and since then there’ve been no concerns.

In fact, another cost you should be aware of would be the wiring cost from the meter. If your charger box is far off from the meter, you should be prepared to spend at least 30k-40k for the wiring alone. Luckily, my charger was next to the meter and hence not too much additional cost.

So, you actually don’t need any support from the EB for installing a charger at home. Hyundai does it for you. The only reason you’d need to visit the Electricity Board would be if your current connection needs to be upgraded. And in my experience, not everyone there are going to be troublesome. In fact, I get extra attention and support from my area technician because he’s also interested in the EV tech. Additionally, with the solar meter installed, he even goes out of his way to have a conversation and provide inputs on how to improve outputs from the solar setup.
I’ve never had to dish any additional cash to the EB.

I disagree. As stated in my earlier response, I’ve not experienced any issues from the Electricity Board. In fact, some of them will actually support you and volunteer information. They’re just as interested in the tech as us. Grid will take time to upgrade, as we’ve seen with the recent coal crisis. And I think, as EVs gain more adoption we will see progress in this direction."

Delta Type 2 chargers can be adjusted to deliver between 1 kW and 7.4 kW. So you can still enjoy home charging at 4 or 5 kW if you have a single-phase line."

Thanks for this information.

I have actually booked an MG ZS EV in October. Unfortunately the MG's charger doesn't allow any adjustments.

The quoted a delivery time of 4-5 months for the Excite model. I received word last week that manufacturing of the 2021 model has ended and it is likely they will start manufacturing the international 2022 model for the next batch. This also meant that the delivery date has been delayed until April 2022.

So I called the Hyundai salesperson from whom we bought my brother's car to ask about the Kona. He said they aren't accepting bookings for the Kona and they have no manufacturing plans for the Kona at the moment. Looks like I have to wait for the MG."

The 2022 model looks much improved so it might be worth the wait. By then you might have more clarity on the 2022 Kona situation also."

"Battery Replacement and Service Update

The battery recall program for Kona, announced in 2021, has finally reached me. My service advisor asked me to bring in the car earlier this week. Luckily, it also coincided with my 2 year service (3rd free service). The whole process took 3 days. Apart from AC filter change and wheel alignment, no other additional service was needed. Once again, total cost of service was zero. That’s a total of zero rupees spent on service of the car in the last 2 years. The service advisors at KUN United are very helpful and special note of appreciation for them. They keep you updated through the process and answer all your queries patiently.

There was another pleasant surprise from Hyundai. The new battery pack has a slightly higher capacity, and the range has increased to 370-380 Kms according to the service advisor. My earlier range was always consistently 330-340 kms, and I’m sure that with the new battery I’ll be able to get 380+ kms. In fact, over the past few weeks I’ve been experimenting more with the eco mode and my average consumption has come down to 10-11 KWH/100 kms as against the 12-13 KWH/100 kms I’ve got in the last couple of years. I’ll test the range in the upcoming weeks, and I’ll see if I can achieve 400 Kms in a single charge.

I have to say that I’m very delighted with the car, and with the new battery pack almost feels like I’ve got a new car. With the Covid third wave almost done, I’m looking forward to increasing the usage of the car and put some serious mileage on it. There’re a few long drives planned in the next few months, and I’ll test the range to its maximum.

Final note, car celebrated its 2nd birthday on 9 February, and with the new battery it feels like the clock has been reset to zero."

My car came with the new battery and I've been getting 380km pretty consistently, although it's down to 350km in the north Indian winter. I drive in Eco mode in the winter and Comfort mode in the summer since I need the extra air-conditioning kick."

Have you actually driven close to 380kms on a single charge or are you going by the value shown by the vehicle? On my MG ZS EV, I have seen range display of as high as 459 but I don’t think I would be actually able to extract that much without taking extreme steps like driving at a slower speed. Note: I have the UK version."

Due to work commitments I’ve not actually been able to go on a long drive. But, the range displayed in the car has only increased to 350 from the 340 it used to show earlier. I’ll need to complete a few more charging cycles probably to get the final number on the system. In any case, I’m able to get the number shown in the system. While Kona advertises itself as having a 444 Kms range, in reality the system only displays 330-340 Kms on a full charge. I do get that range in real life too. I’ll test it over the next few weeks to see if there’s any change to this range. As per service advisor, I should get atleast 20 Kms more than what I used to get earlier. So, that’s why I’m hoping I’ll get atleast 360-370 Kms. I generally drive in Comfort mode with auto climate and have consumption figures of 11-12 KWH/100 Kms."

"I have a request to everyone discussing the range in this thread. If it's possible, can you please post if the car is being driven within the city or highway and if on the highway what was the maximum speed touched as well?"

After you asked I actually charged my car to 100% and drove it down to 4%. Covered 370 km with 15 km left. Generally Kona range projections are said to be accurate.

Keep in mind that I am a conservative driver and drove in Eco mode with speeds in the 45-55 km/h range and with the airconditioning off."

Thanks for taking the time to test it. That is great range. Was this all in a single trip or a combination of multiple trips? Unless it was city driving, how did you manage to keep speed so low?"

I don’t have a recent example to share. But, I have done a long distance drive in the recent past (November 2021). Highway drive with Comfort mode, 3 adults and 2 kids load, AC always on, cruise control set to 75 kmph, I could drive 333 Kms on a single charge to the nearest charging point and still had over 70 Kms range left. Adding a picture of the consumption chart from the car.

My regular driving is within the city, and it gives an average range of 340 Kms over a few days of usage. All with average speed of 40-50 kmph and peak speeds of 100 kmph (only on empty stretch of road where there’s absolutely no traffic). I don’t adapt a different style of driving and use the car the same way I use my XUV500."

Thank you. This helped me greatly to understand the current-gen Kona's capabilities in terms of battery."

This was over five days or so, all city driving."
