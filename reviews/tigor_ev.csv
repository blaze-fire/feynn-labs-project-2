Tata Tiago is one of the best EVs considering in its price range. The comfort level is actually amazing. The best part about it is the colour of it is so attractive.
Smooth driving experience with low running cost & high safety rating. Built quality is impressive. After driving this car for 2 months I don't want to drive any IC engine car.
"Everything is awesome in this car, mileage and maintenance cost are good. It was good experience for me and overall it's a great car. "
It is a very comfortable and safest car for long travel. It's good looking also.
"The best electric vehicle to buy on a low budget which needs low maintenance, and is very powerful, it has amazing performance."
"The mileage of Tata Tigor is very good and also comfortable boot space, it is a very good car for every 5 people such average is not in any electric car. There is no better car in strength than a Tata car. I love this car."
"Tigor Petrol price is 7 lakhs on the road whereas EV price is 13 lakhs on road. It means you are paying 6 lakhs more in advance ( Add interest cost on the additional amount if financed through the bank) that way you are not saving on fuel costs. Secondly, the range will go on to decrease over the years as the battery life will reduce. Secondly, inc..."
"The best electric car I have ever seen, it's better than MG because it's half the price and the same mileage, but lacks some features."
"It provides so many features, power steering, airbags, fog lights, anti-lock braking system. Worth purchasing the car."
"Just drove 500 km with the new Tigor EV, I would say the performance is just perfect for urban driving."
"This is my first Tata car, and it's Tigor dual-tone EV. It's amazing to drive. Cheaper for another car to purchase. Go for it, and give something to the nation. Enjoying.üëç"
"Overall a great experience with some nitty-gritty here and there. The car offers great comfort and a smooth driving experience, but the Tata Z connect app is buggy and sluggish. Although I found an app called Keemut, which offered a lot better experience than Tata Z connect with more features. Do check out Keemut if you want to know better about th..."
Tata should introduce white and light colors like silver and grey in Tigor EV. Customers are waiting for the same.
Budget eve. Indian customers will prefer this. Good car overall with traction control and hill descent
"Value for money. Good mileage rs1 for 1km, cost-efficient and reliable car for city drive, fun driving."
"One of the only options available in EVs gets the same features as the regular Tigor. Since it's an EV you need to worry about the fuel prices, but it seems a little overpriced, at least to me."
"Tata Tigor quality is best for other company's. Made in Indian-built quality, the most popular car in the world. Performance was good"
"I like Tata cars, and also like EV in the best price range for middle-class, people can afford this car, so I love this car, thanks to Tata"
"1.Buying Experience good 2.Riding Experience is ok and nice 3. Not a good performance looks good. 4. Worst service center, Worst reply from them after getting the car they never take care of your car issues. 5. Pros - no petrol or diesel Silent ride Cons: At few hundred kms car suddenly stopped. It did not start. I called the service center Andheri. The reply was worst. Feeling bad why we bought the car. Tried to sell the car but every one is asking for a very low price. Please solve the service center problem first than selling more cars. If the service is good, other brand people will also suggest this brand and buy more."
The feel was awesome when drove this car. I must suggest you to atleast have a test drive for this car and believe it for yourself. Super power machine at a best price. You can go for it.
Best car in the country with best performance and best looks. The driving is a beautiful experience in the world I love Tata and the company is very valuable.
"Riding experience was okay. It still makes a lot of noise that an electric car should not make. Looks good but the wheels are way too small which gives it a donkey like look. The colors are great but service staff was very rude. After the sale has been made the car does make a lot of noises and it is not very fast as an electric should be, and people who thump their chests on the name of Tata being the Indian brand, let me say that all the components are Chinese. Pros: electric, cons: price, performance, range anxiety, charging time. One must wait for under 10 lac EVs (2-3 years wait) or buy Nexon EV if you really have to."
It's great experience to drive this ev car and it is perfectly design sedan car can beat any other sedan .... Like ev cars you can compare budget sedan car to your mileage concern... As per the torque or pick up you get never complain to Tata
A good car but overpriced a little. The starting price at 11 L would have been better for customers. Though features and mileage looks good for city drive. What gives us fear is the Tata zconnect app subscription which may be free for only one year. I wish subscription won't burn pockets as that is still in development and not up to mark yet to be charged. And also little worried about Soc drop issues.
Excellent vehicle driving dynamics and EVs are now at affordable price. This is breakthrough product in market for small car with such aspirational single charge distance and extra ordinary features.
"After government subsidy it becomes cheaper than diesel car in its segment, so good car for city use as well as for short distance trip. good cabin and boot space, good pick up as 74 bhp and 170 NM torque is almost equal to ddis diesel engine of maruti. Battery and motor warranty of 8 years and 160000 km so complete Peace of mind."
Yes I love tata products .. A true Indian company.. But I thought tata Tigor EV price will be 11 lac on road for top end model.. But today company released the model and price. mentioned price not reachable to the even above middle class. And all the states are not giving subsidy.. I belong to AP.. So Tata group please launch Tiago EV @9 lac on road price. With 275 km for single charge.. Thank you TATA group.
"I am planning to buy. I am driving this car since long and its amazing. Its grey colour is fantastic and a blue line is superb. I don't know about his service Its advantage is its electric vehicle. No use of petrol diesel or gas. Disadvantage is nothing in my way. Tata is a good manufacturer of cars because of its safety, I owned a Nexon Zest, Nano, and Indigo . Zest and Nexon performance is excellent in service cost and fuel economy cost and maintenance cost is in the budget"
