"Best car for day-to-day work and for long rides. It has a great performance and smooth driving, the good thing is that its running cost is very low and service cost is also low as compared to other brand cars. "
"The great driving experience, and overall value for money car. Its exterior, looks, interiors, and comfort were also good."
"Nice to drive and comfortable for traveling, safety features are so good. It is a low cost compared to other EV cars."
"The looks are awesome from the primary colour to the interiors. Seats are too comfortable, lots of space yet little not enough for the whole family. Of course, EV is the best and most sustainable, yet looks so trendy.  Overall awesome. "
Nice car with good build quality and safety. Performance and mileage are too good and easy to drive with low maintenance.
"Love this vehicle. Features are too good. Even at this price, no one gives this kind of fabulous car. I will suggest to you, it is a value for money. Go for it."
"It is one of the best EVs, gives a luxury feel and the interior of the vehicle is pretty great. Specifications like the ground clearance and sound system are good."
"Tata has truly come up with the best in class electric cars which is a great combination of price, ride quality and battery efficiency."
"Overall good car and the style of the car is attractive. It has great security features, it comes with airbags and the interior is awesome."
"My friend has bought this car and when I try to drive it. Such a cool car. Believe me or not this is the revolution in the Indian Electric car segment, both in terms of comfort as well as performance."
"This car comes in the budget segment, which is great to see and fulfills the requirements of a middle-class family. Best in the segment for electric under 20L."
"Nice performance, full comfort in the car. Very stylish looks. Full Safety, maintenance cost is very low and mileage is good. "
"It's a wonderful car, it offered a smooth engine and is easy to drive. The driving quality is also good. This is a value for money car."
"It is a very good car as compared to other EVs. The Interior is also up to the mark. Its mileage is impressive, and the acceleration is fantastic."
Let me clarify this. Nexon and Tiger EV is the only affordable car for all buyers which gives ample amount of less maintenance as well as performance. Honestly speaking Nexon is a good start from TATA and has a good potential in the market compared with others.
"The car is excellent in safety, being electric per km running cost is very less. the car is very spacious and comfortable for sitting. Even the electric charging points are now on the pick so that you can take your car for a spin on the long road,"
"I bought Nexon EV last Friday. I used it on Saturday and plug for charging. Battery overheating alarm flashed while charging. Since then my new vehicle is in the service station (122km driven only). Battery discharging very fast. Very disappointed with Nexon EV. Moreover, the dealer has not solved my problem yet. They don't have enough ma..."
"I am using the car for more than a year. The car is good and peppy. It looks rich from the inside with great design. The issue is the mileage on a full charge in sports mode is around 125km, and the normal is around 190km. Another thing really really bad is you need to pay Rs3600/year for the Connect app - rip off!! How can you make so mu..."
"Really happy to have Tata Nexon EV. It gives good mileage, charging is easy, and more than that we are contributing to the environment along with Tata. "
It is the best vehicle in the market currently in the EV sector. It has great performance and delivers smooth driving. Its range is also good.
"I have done my 2nd service of my Nexon EV LUX. I drove 7800 km, 5 months over. I found 3 times there is a sudden drop in battery percentage from 60% to 20% 1st time and 2nd time the battery percentage dropped from 50% to 22%. This is really horrifying if u go for a long drive then you will be in real soups. Sometimes I feel I have done a mistake in..."
"Nice mileage, better battery, performance, nice look, stylish body. Best car ever."
The best car by Tata. The only thing I don't like about Nexon. It looks from behind and the best thing is a super affordable electric car.
Recently I did a road trip with Tata Nexon and traveled 1000 km in just 1000 Rupees. Sharing the blog with all the folks. Who are interested in purchasing Nexon EV.
"EV vehicle is good, but battery suddenly dropping, this is very dangers and uncomfortable thing. Yesterday Nexon EV vehicle backdowns at remaining battery 30%. I am not advised to opt for EV Vehicles."
"One of my worst decision was to buy an EV. The range is very limited, can't operate AC to ensure reaching home without being stuck in the middle. Lot of problems with SBM, and it is damn costly to maintain this. Pathetic car, don't buy, not worth it at all. Petrol cars are far much better, prices are high as of now but I'll come down eventually"
"I bought this vehicle on 08/10/21, at the time of delivery the display shows it can run 89km. Only on 10/10/21, they fixed the charger in my house. After full charge (100% CHARGE) the display shows only 173 km. Tata in their ADS(Automated Driving Systems) telling 312km it can run. If the battery charging itself shows 173 km means how it can for 312..."
"Best EV as of now. The car is very stable. And the sports mode is ultimate. You can get a range of 180 to 190 with AC, without AC you Can Get a Range of 200 to 220. We are satisfied with the car! Product By Tata"
"The battery does not charge fully. does not give the range as the company says. The company says the range is 250 km per charge but only goes 160 km per charge. After car service, the battery issue was not resolved at all. And car stops in the middle of the road due to service error only after 2 days of service."
"This is the only Electric Vehicle available with reliable latest battery aided technology coupled with safety - both features and builds quality. Added Automatic is a big plus. Looks - 5/5 Pickup/Drag - 5/5 Battery Range - 4/5 Only the slightest flaw I found is the Rotatory knob for shifting driving modes(Eco, City, Sport). Tata should consider thi..."

"Nice performance, full comfort in the car. Very stylish looks. Full Safety, maintenance cost is very low and mileage is good. "
"It's a wonderful car, it offered a smooth engine and is easy to drive. The driving quality is also good. This is a value for money car."
"It is a very good car as compared to other EVs. The Interior is also up to the mark. Its mileage is impressive, and the acceleration is fantastic."
Let me clarify this. Nexon and Tiger EV is the only affordable car for all buyers which gives ample amount of less maintenance as well as performance. Honestly speaking Nexon is a good start from TATA and has a good potential in the market compared with others.

"Nice mileage, better battery, performance, nice look, stylish body. Best car ever."
The best car by Tata. The only thing I don't like about Nexon. It looks from behind and the best thing is a super affordable electric car.
Recently I did a road trip with Tata Nexon and traveled 1000 km in just 1000 Rupees. Sharing the blog with all the folks. Who are interested in purchasing Nexon EV.
"EV vehicle is good, but battery suddenly dropping, this is very dangers and uncomfortable thing. Yesterday Nexon EV vehicle backdowns at remaining battery 30%. I am not advised to opt for EV Vehicles."
"One of my worst decision was to buy an EV. The range is very limited, can't operate AC to ensure reaching home without being stuck in the middle. Lot of problems with SBM, and it is damn costly to maintain this. Pathetic car, don't buy, not worth it at all. Petrol cars are far much better, prices are high as of now but I'll come down eventually"
"I bought this vehicle on 08/10/21, at the time of delivery the display shows it can run 89km. Only on 10/10/21, they fixed the charger in my house.

If the battery charging itself shows 173 km means how it can for 312..."
"Best EV as of now. The car is very stable. And the sports mode is ultimate. You can get a range of 180 to 190 with AC, without AC you Can Get a Range of 200 to 220. We are satisfied with the car! Product By Tata"
"The battery does not charge fully. does not give the range as the company says. The company says the range is 250 km per charge but only goes 160 km per charge. After car service, the battery issue was not resolved at all. And car stops in the middle of the road due to service error only after 2 days of service."

"Really happy to have Tata Nexon EV. It gives good mileage, charging is easy, and more than that we are contributing to the environment along with Tata. "
It is the best vehicle in the market currently in the EV sector. It has great performance and delivers smooth driving. Its range is also good.

"Nice mileage, better battery, performance, nice look, stylish body. Best car ever."
The best car by Tata. The only thing I don't like about Nexon. It looks from behind and the best thing is a super affordable electric car.
Recently I did a road trip with Tata Nexon and traveled 1000 km in just 1000 Rupees. Sharing the blog with all the folks. Who are interested in purchasing Nexon EV.
"EV vehicle is good, but battery suddenly dropping, this is very dangers and uncomfortable thing. Yesterday Nexon EV vehicle backdowns at remaining battery 30%. I am not advised to opt for EV Vehicles."
"One of my worst decision was to buy an EV. The range is very limited, can't operate AC to ensure reaching home without being stuck in the middle. Lot of problems with SBM, and it is damn costly to maintain this. Pathetic car, don't buy, not worth it at all. Petrol cars are far much better, prices are high as of now but I'll come down eventually"
"I bought this vehicle on 08/10/21, at the time of delivery the display shows it can run 89km. Only on 10/10/21, they fixed the charger in my house.

If the battery charging itself shows 173 km means how it can for 312..."
"Best EV as of now. The car is very stable. And the sports mode is ultimate. You can get a range of 180 to 190 with AC, without AC you Can Get a Range of 200 to 220. We are satisfied with the car! Product By Tata"
"The battery does not charge fully. does not give the range as the company says. The company says the range is 250 km per charge but only goes 160 km per charge. After car service, the battery issue was not resolved at all. And car stops in the middle of the road due to service error only after 2 days of service."

"Really happy to have Tata Nexon EV. It gives good mileage, charging is easy, and more than that we are contributing to the environment along with Tata. "
It is the best vehicle in the market currently in the EV sector. It has great performance and delivers smooth driving. Its range is also good.
"I have done my 2nd service of my Nexon EV LUX. I drove 7800 km, 5 months over. I found 3 times there is a sudden drop in battery percentage from 60% to 20% 1st time and 2nd time the battery percentage dropped from 50% to 22%. This is really horrifying if u go for a long drive then you will be in real soups. Sometimes I feel I have done a mistake in..."
"Nice mileage, better battery, performance, nice look, stylish body. Best car ever."
The best car by Tata. The only thing I don't like about Nexon. It looks from behind and the best thing is a super affordable electric car.
Recently I did a road trip with Tata Nexon and traveled 1000 km in just 1000 Rupees. Sharing the blog with all the folks. Who are interested in purchasing Nexon EV.
"EV vehicle is good, but battery suddenly dropping, this is very dangers and uncomfortable thing. Yesterday Nexon EV vehicle backdowns at remaining battery 30%. I am not advised to opt for EV Vehicles."
"One of my worst decision was to buy an EV. The range is very limited, can't operate AC to ensure reaching home without being stuck in the middle. Lot of problems with SBM, and it is damn costly to maintain this. Pathetic car, don't buy, not worth it at all. Petrol cars are far much better, prices are high as of now but I'll come down eventually"
"I bought this vehicle on 08/10/21, at the time of delivery the display shows it can run 89km. Only on 10/10/21, they fixed the charger in my house. After full charge (100% CHARGE) the display shows only 173 km. Tata in their ADS(Automated Driving Systems) telling 312km it can run. If the battery charging itself shows 173 km means how it can for 312..."
"Best EV as of now. The car is very stable. And the sports mode is ultimate. You can get a range of 180 to 190 with AC, without AC you Can Get a Range of 200 to 220. We are satisfied with the car! Product By Tata"
"The battery does not charge fully. does not give the range as the company says. The company says the range is 250 km per charge but only goes 160 km per charge. After car service, the battery issue was not resolved at all. And car stops in the middle of the road due to service error only after 2 days of service."

"Best car for day-to-day work and for long rides. It has a great performance and smooth driving, the good thing is that its running cost is very low and service cost is also low as compared to other brand cars. "
"The great driving experience, and overall value for money car. Its exterior, looks, interiors, and comfort were also good."
"Nice to drive and comfortable for traveling, safety features are so good. It is a low cost compared to other EV cars."
"The looks are awesome from the primary colour to the interiors. Seats are too comfortable, lots of space yet little not enough for the whole family. Of course, EV is the best and most sustainable, yet looks so trendy.  Overall awesome. "
Nice car with good build quality and safety. Performance and mileage are too good and easy to drive with low maintenance.
"Love this vehicle. Features are too good. Even at this price, no one gives this kind of fabulous car. I will suggest to you, it is a value for money. Go for it."
"It is one of the best EVs, gives a luxury feel and the interior of the vehicle is pretty great. Specifications like the ground clearance and sound system are good."
"Tata has truly come up with the best in class electric cars which is a great combination of price, ride quality and battery efficiency."
"Overall good car and the style of the car is attractive. It has great security features, it comes with airbags and the interior is awesome."
"My friend has bought this car and when I try to drive it. Such a cool car. Believe me or not this is the revolution in the Indian Electric car segment, both in terms of comfort as well as performance."
"This car comes in the budget segment, which is great to see and fulfills the requirements of a middle-class family. Best in the segment for electric under 20L."
"Nice performance, full comfort in the car. Very stylish looks. Full Safety, maintenance cost is very low and mileage is good. "
"It's a wonderful car, it offered a smooth engine and is easy to drive. The driving quality is also good. This is a value for money car."
"It is a very good car as compared to other EVs. The Interior is also up to the mark. Its mileage is impressive, and the acceleration is fantastic."
Let me clarify this. Nexon and Tiger EV is the only affordable car for all buyers which gives ample amount of less maintenance as well as performance. Honestly speaking Nexon is a good start from TATA and has a good potential in the market compared with others.
"The car is excellent in safety, being electric per km running cost is very less. the car is very spacious and comfortable for sitting. Even the electric charging points are now on the pick so that you can take your car for a spin on the long road,"
"I bought Nexon EV last Friday. I used it on Saturday and plug for charging. Battery overheating alarm flashed while charging. Since then my new vehicle is in the service station (122km driven only).

Recently I did a road trip with Tata Nexon and traveled 1000 km in just 1000 Rupees. Sharing the blog with all the folks. Who are interested in purchasing Nexon EV.
"EV vehicle is good, but battery suddenly dropping, this is very dangers and uncomfortable thing. Yesterday Nexon EV vehicle backdowns at remaining battery 30%. I am not advised to opt for EV Vehicles."
"One of my worst decision was to buy an EV. The range is very limited, can't operate AC to ensure reaching home without being stuck in the middle. Lot of problems with SBM, and it is damn costly to maintain this. Pathetic car, don't buy, not worth it at all. Petrol cars are far much better, prices are high as of now but I'll come down eventually"
"I bought this vehicle on 08/10/21, at the time of delivery the display shows it can run 89km. Only on 10/10/21, they fixed the charger in my house. After full charge (100% CHARGE) the display shows only 173 km. Tata in their ADS(Automated Driving Systems) telling 312km it can run. If the battery charging itself shows 173 km means how it can for 312..."
"Best EV as of now. The car is very stable. And the sports mode is ultimate. You can get a range of 180 to 190 with AC, without AC you Can Get a Range of 200 to 220. We are satisfied with the car! Product By Tata"
"The battery does not charge fully. does not give the range as the company says. The company says the range is 250 km per charge but only goes 160 km per charge. After car service, the battery issue was not resolved at all. And car stops in the middle of the road due to service error only after 2 days of service."

"Best car for day-to-day work and for long rides. It has a great performance and smooth driving, the good thing is that its running cost is very low and service cost is also low as compared to other brand cars. "
"The great driving experience, and overall value for money car. Its exterior, looks, interiors, and comfort were also good."
"Nice to drive and comfortable for traveling, safety features are so good. It is a low cost compared to other EV cars."
"The looks are awesome from the primary colour to the interiors. Seats are too comfortable, lots of space yet little not enough for the whole family. Of course, EV is the best and most sustainable, yet looks so trendy.  Overall awesome. "
Nice car with good build quality and safety. Performance and mileage are too good and easy to drive with low maintenance.
"Love this vehicle. Features are too good. Even at this price, no one gives this kind of fabulous car. I will suggest to you, it is a value for money. Go for it."
"It is one of the best EVs, gives a luxury feel and the interior of the vehicle is pretty great. Specifications like the ground clearance and sound system are good."
"Tata has truly come up with the best in class electric cars which is a great combination of price, ride quality and battery efficiency."
"Overall good car and the style of the car is attractive. It has great security features, it comes with airbags and the interior is awesome."
"My friend has bought this car and when I try to drive it. Such a cool car. Believe me or not this is the revolution in the Indian Electric car segment, both in terms of comfort as well as performance."
"This car comes in the budget segment, which is great to see and fulfills the requirements of a middle-class family. Best in the segment for electric under 20L."
"Nice performance, full comfort in the car. Very stylish looks. Full Safety, maintenance cost is very low and mileage is good. "
"It's a wonderful car, it offered a smooth engine and is easy to drive. The driving quality is also good. This is a value for money car."
"It is a very good car as compared to other EVs. The Interior is also up to the mark. Its mileage is impressive, and the acceleration is fantastic."
Let me clarify this. Nexon and Tiger EV is the only affordable car for all buyers which gives ample amount of less maintenance as well as performance. Honestly speaking Nexon is a good start from TATA and has a good potential in the market compared with others.
"The car is excellent in safety, being electric per km running cost is very less. the car is very spacious and comfortable for sitting. Even the electric charging points are now on the pick so that you can take your car for a spin on the long road,"
"I bought Nexon EV last Friday. I used it on Saturday and plug for charging. Battery overheating alarm flashed while charging. Since then my new vehicle is in the service station (122km driven only). Battery discharging very fast. Very disappointed with Nexon EV. Moreover, the dealer has not solved my problem yet. They don't have enough ma..."
"I am using the car for more than a year. The car is good and peppy. It looks rich from the inside with great design. The issue is the mileage on a full charge in sports mode is around 125km, and the normal is around 190km. Another thing really really bad is you need to pay Rs3600/year for the Connect app - rip off!! How can you make so mu..."
"Really happy to have Tata Nexon EV. It gives good mileage, charging is easy, and more than that we are contributing to the environment along with Tata. "
It is the best vehicle in the market currently in the EV sector. It has great performance and delivers smooth driving. Its range is also good.
"I have done my 2nd service of my Nexon EV LUX. I drove 7800 km, 5 months over. I found 3 times there is a sudden drop in battery percentage from 60% to 20% 1st time and 2nd time the battery percentage dropped from 50% to 22%.

"Best car for day-to-day work and for long rides. It has a great performance and smooth driving, the good thing is that its running cost is very low and service cost is also low as compared to other brand cars. "
"The great driving experience, and overall value for money car. Its exterior, looks, interiors, and comfort were also good."
"Nice to drive and comfortable for traveling, safety features are so good. It is a low cost compared to other EV cars."
"The looks are awesome from the primary colour to the interiors. Seats are too comfortable, lots of space yet little not enough for the whole family. Of course, EV is the best and most sustainable, yet looks so trendy.  Overall awesome. "
Nice car with good build quality and safety. Performance and mileage are too good and easy to drive with low maintenance.
"Love this vehicle. Features are too good. Even at this price, no one gives this kind of fabulous car. I will suggest to you, it is a value for money. Go for it."
"It is one of the best EVs, gives a luxury feel and the interior of the vehicle is pretty great. Specifications like the ground clearance and sound system are good."
"Tata has truly come up with the best in class electric cars which is a great combination of price, ride quality and battery efficiency."
"Overall good car and the style of the car is attractive. It has great security features, it comes with airbags and the interior is awesome."
"My friend has bought this car and when I try to drive it. Such a cool car. Believe me or not this is the revolution in the Indian Electric car segment, both in terms of comfort as well as performance."
"This car comes in the budget segment, which is great to see and fulfills the requirements of a middle-class family. Best in the segment for electric under 20L."
"Nice performance, full comfort in the car. Very stylish looks. Full Safety, maintenance cost is very low and mileage is good. "
"It's a wonderful car, it offered a smooth engine and is easy to drive. The driving quality is also good. This is a value for money car."
"It is a very good car as compared to other EVs. The Interior is also up to the mark. Its mileage is impressive, and the acceleration is fantastic."
Let me clarify this. Nexon and Tiger EV is the only affordable car for all buyers which gives ample amount of less maintenance as well as performance. Honestly speaking Nexon is a good start from TATA and has a good potential in the market compared with others.
"The car is excellent in safety, being electric per km running cost is very less. the car is very spacious and comfortable for sitting. Even the electric charging points are now on the pick so that you can take your car for a spin on the long road,"
"I bought Nexon EV last Friday. I used it on Saturday and plug for charging. Battery overheating alarm flashed while charging. Since then my new vehicle is in the service station (122km driven only).

"Really happy to have Tata Nexon EV. It gives good mileage, charging is easy, and more than that we are contributing to the environment along with Tata. "

"Nice mileage, better battery, performance, nice look, stylish body. Best car ever."
The best car by Tata. The only thing I don't like about Nexon. It looks from behind and the best thing is a super affordable electric car.
Recently I did a road trip with Tata Nexon and traveled 1000 km in just 1000 Rupees. Sharing the blog with all the folks. Who are interested in purchasing Nexon EV.
"EV vehicle is good, but battery suddenly dropping, this is very dangers and uncomfortable thing. Yesterday Nexon EV vehicle backdowns at remaining battery 30%. I am not advised to opt for EV Vehicles."
"One of my worst decision was to buy an EV. The range is very limited, can't operate AC to ensure reaching home without being stuck in the middle. Lot of problems with SBM, and it is damn costly to maintain this. Pathetic car, don't buy, not worth it at all.

reviews
"Best car for day-to-day work and for long rides. It has a great performance and smooth driving, the good thing is that its running cost is very low and service cost is also low as compared to other brand cars. "
"The great driving experience, and overall value for money car. Its exterior, looks, interiors, and comfort were also good."
"Nice to drive and comfortable for traveling, safety features are so good. It is a low cost compared to other EV cars."
"The looks are awesome from the primary colour to the interiors. Seats are too comfortable, lots of space yet little not enough for the whole family. Of course, EV is the best and most sustainable, yet looks so trendy.  Overall awesome. "
Nice car with good build quality and safety. Performance and mileage are too good and easy to drive with low maintenance.
"Love this vehicle. Features are too good. Even at this price, no one gives this kind of fabulous car. I will suggest to you, it is a value for money. Go for it."
"It is one of the best EVs, gives a luxury feel and the interior of the vehicle is pretty great. Specifications like the ground clearance and sound system are good."
"Tata has truly come up with the best in class electric cars which is a great combination of price, ride quality and battery efficiency."
"Overall good car and the style of the car is attractive. It has great security features, it comes with airbags and the interior is awesome."
"My friend has bought this car and when I try to drive it. Such a cool car. Believe me or not this is the revolution in the Indian Electric car segment, both in terms of comfort as well as performance."
"This car comes in the budget segment, which is great to see and fulfills the requirements of a middle-class family. Best in the segment for electric under 20L."
"Nice performance, full comfort in the car. Very stylish looks. Full Safety, maintenance cost is very low and mileage is good. "
"It's a wonderful car, it offered a smooth engine and is easy to drive. The driving quality is also good. This is a value for money car."
"It is a very good car as compared to other EVs. The Interior is also up to the mark. Its mileage is impressive, and the acceleration is fantastic."
Let me clarify this. Nexon and Tiger EV is the only affordable car for all buyers which gives ample amount of less maintenance as well as performance. Honestly speaking Nexon is a good start from TATA and has a good potential in the market compared with others.
"The car is excellent in safety, being electric per km running cost is very less. the car is very spacious and comfortable for sitting. Even the electric charging points are now on the pick so that you can take your car for a spin on the long road,"
"I bought Nexon EV last Friday. I used it on Saturday and plug for charging. Battery overheating alarm flashed while charging. Since then my new vehicle is in the service station (122km driven only). Battery discharging very fast. Very disappointed with Nexon EV. Moreover, the dealer has not solved my problem yet. They don't have enough ma..."
"I am using the car for more than a year. The car is good and peppy. It looks rich from the inside with great design. The issue is the mileage on a full charge in sports mode is around 125km, and the normal is around 190km. Another thing really really bad is you need to pay Rs3600/year for the Connect app - rip off!! How can you make so mu..."
"Really happy to have Tata Nexon EV. It gives good mileage, charging is easy, and more than that we are contributing to the environment along with Tata. "
It is the best vehicle in the market currently in the EV sector. It has great performance and delivers smooth driving. Its range is also good.
"I have done my 2nd service of my Nexon EV LUX. I drove 7800 km, 5 months over. I found 3 times there is a sudden drop in battery percentage from 60% to 20% 1st time and 2nd time the battery percentage dropped from 50% to 22%. This is really horrifying if u go for a long drive then you will be in real soups. Sometimes I feel I have done a mistake in..."
"Nice mileage, better battery, performance, nice look, stylish body. Best car ever."
The best car by Tata. The only thing I don't like about Nexon. It looks from behind and the best thing is a super affordable electric car.
Recently I did a road trip with Tata Nexon and traveled 1000 km in just 1000 Rupees. Sharing the blog with all the folks. Who are interested in purchasing Nexon EV.
"EV vehicle is good, but battery suddenly dropping, this is very dangers and uncomfortable thing. Yesterday Nexon EV vehicle backdowns at remaining battery 30%. I am not advised to opt for EV Vehicles."
"One of my worst decision was to buy an EV. The range is very limited, can't operate AC to ensure reaching home without being stuck in the middle. Lot of problems with SBM, and it is damn costly to maintain this. Pathetic car, don't buy, not worth it at all. Petrol cars are far much better, prices are high as of now but I'll come down eventually"
"I bought this vehicle on 08/10/21, at the time of delivery the display shows it can run 89km. Only on 10/10/21, they fixed the charger in my house. After full charge (100% CHARGE) the display shows only 173 km. Tata in their ADS(Automated Driving Systems) telling 312km it can run. If the battery charging itself shows 173 km means how it can for 312..."
"Best EV as of now. The car is very stable. And the sports mode is ultimate. You can get a range of 180 to 190 with AC, without AC you Can Get a Range of 200 to 220. We are satisfied with the car! Product By Tata"
"The battery does not charge fully. does not give the range as the company says. The company says the range is 250 km per charge but only goes 160 km per charge. After car service, the battery issue was not resolved at all. And car stops in the middle of the road due to service error only after 2 days of service."
"This is the only Electric Vehicle available with reliable latest battery aided technology coupled with safety - both features and builds quality. Added Automatic is a big plus. Looks - 5/5 Pickup/Drag - 5/5 Battery Range - 4/5 Only the slightest flaw I found is the Rotatory knob for shifting driving modes(Eco, City, Sport). Tata should consider thi..."
"TATA has put in much effort in bringing out the Nexon EV, considering the many downsides associated with fossil-fuelled vehicles. Kudos to that. And whiles the mileage of any car depends on judicious driving, the claimed mileage is way off!!"
Tata doesn't provide any safety or any facility regarding defective product customers are facing so many problems. Battery drops and software problem they must replace the defective product
"Don't buy this car, just after a day of purchase battery percentage by 30-40%. There are new issues now. even with 95% battery, its system is detecting 0 battery and the car is locked with limp mode. You can get stranded anytime, anywhere even with a full battery."
"I really love this Tata Nexon EV, its really very nice and comfortable car and it's a battery car so overall, I love it."
"It is a very good car with a sunroof on it. Art of car generation in India. I like the space in the car to relax, and it makes no sound. It is a pleasure to have this car"
"A great car considering the other EV options in the market are much more expensive. Brilliant performance, especially in 'S' mode. A realistic range of 210-240kms and depending on your driving style, you can get more. Features are good and it's actually a very practical car for future-oriented people. Solidly built as the ICE Nexon, yet this one fe..."
"Wonder car at the best price, pickup amazing, drivability so smooth, service expenses negligible and above zero pollution"
"Amazing pickup, great performance, and also mileage and rang appropriately 240 km which is great."
"I recently bought this vehicle, but not happy with the mileage that Tata claims, they are making fool out of us. "
This is a very good car. Its driving is very amazing. No noise and no pollution. The charging speed is very good.
It is a fantastic car. Mileage 280+km in lightfoot driving. Features and looks are also great.
The leader from India grown to be the most globalised product. Very Happy with performance If only the dealership and service centre lives up to the car quality.
I am very much interested in this car but the cost is the only issue. If it decreases to around 10 lakh it will be affordable.
Very nice car it looks very awesome and its performance is wonderful. It's interior is very nice.
Very good Jarvis. The most efficient in this segment in India. Tata Nexon is one of the most powerful 35kw batteries.
My next car could be a Nexon or any other electric car which is best at that time. I think to buy my next car in 2022.
After reading all such reviews I would like to have this Electric miracle in 2027-28 when It would be more affordable to me in the range of 7-8 Lacs. I am eagerly waiting for the day to make this Fabulous EV my own mate.
My next car could be a Nexon or any other electric car which is best at that time I think to buy my next car in 2026 or 2027.
Charging stations are less available and running range also not sufficient. These are two main drawbacks of Tata Nexon EV.
"Tata Nexon EV is one of the best affordable long-range electric vehicle available in India. In sports mode, it has 60% more torque that's a good property of this vehicle. Looks are also good."
"Hindustan ki full safety car, best mileage, full comfortable SUV is smooth for long root drive, music system is best."
TATA should also provide a stabilizer with a home charging unit as voltage fluctuation frequently stops car charging. It took us some time to understand the cause of the issue.
I am highly disappointed by this car due to the range and behavior of the dealer. I am driving this car daily for the last four months and very much upset by the real-world range. I really feel cheated.
Total safety and electric car. Safety first priority of Tata As you know and Nexon is the safest car so Nexon Ev will be double the safest.
"Driving the car for more than a month now. Pros: 1. Silent car, no noise, and vibration. 2. very little maintenance cost. 3.easy to charge. Cons: 1. Company claims a range of 300 but the real-world range is 140 km per charge with AC, and 150 km without AC. 2. Interiors are very average, plastic quality feels cheap and makes a squeaking sound. 3. St..."
Guys this is my personal experience please do not buy it I have purchased this car on 24/10/2020. I found this is not running properly and suddenly it's gone break down I called the team and they have taken it for a survey and after 8 days its sudden stop on road and they again take it and admit is as a patient. My recommendation is not to buy it t...
"Next-generation should buy this type of vehicle. it's good for human beings also. I have watched all videos and came to a point that THIS IS OUR FUTURE NOTHING ELSE. I am sure, in the coming years there will be no petrol pump only charging stations and once we all are ready to buy these types of EV then Government will be pressurized and also ..."
This is an amazing SUV car. This is a highly safe car. This is also looking good car. The mileage of this car is also good.
"Upgrade in Tata Motors in on next level Best service, Electric car of India with the lowest price. Thumps up to Ratan Tata."
Nexon EV price should be under 10L for top-end variant - Adding extra rage extender battery would be better as a standard feature for all EV vehicles - Battery Swapping technology is a must for EVs for better demand - Govt should announce 100% tax exemption for the purchase of any EVs until 2030 - Mileage limits should be announced by Govt under 1l...
"In Nexon EV sometimes having a gear mode changing issue. It can't turn to drive mode sometimes, it stays in neutral. It is a big issue. The showroom has made it alright, but I think there might be the same issue all along."
"I have seen lots of reviews regarding the Nexon EV Range in Kolkata, some say 150, 180, 200. But for my friends, i have daily commute of 70-80 KM and in the city, I am getting 220-230 range with a single charge. The Sales Person of TATA was true that the running cost is Rs. 1/- per KM and service cost is NIL. Nexon comfort and Value for money ..."
"Am using Nexon EV XZ+ LUX in Chennai for the past one month, basically for the urban commute. Getting a range of 210km for 100%. Normally I recharge it when it comes to 25% for which I used to get a range of 165 to 170kms (for 75%). This is with AC and infotainment. I have used only AC slow charger till now, never used DC fast charger. - Daily trav..."
"As a fresh convert to driving a car with a green streak, the most striking thing is that the Nexon EV Lux+ (top end) is noiseless. Second is tremendous power and smooth acceleration of the electric motor felt at the word go. The many sensors that make auto settings possible delight you and sometimes surprise you like to headlamps, the rain-sensing ..."
"It is a wonderful car to drive. However, I faced some problems which could have been quite dangerous for me and others in the car. The car suddenly switched to neutral while on the move and the steering and brakes, which are power-assisted, stopped to work. Luckily, the car was slow so it came to a halt very soon. Otherwise, could have been a major..."
The electric vehicles are pollution-free and noiseless. The efficiency and performance of these are good.
"I have booked Tata Nexon EV on 24th Dec 2019. I have done an online booking. After the Car Launch, Tata assigned a relationship manager to answer any queries. RM promised me that car will be delivered by mid End of Feb 2020. He kept changing the delivery dates after Feb and the car was never delivered till March-end. After that lockdown started and..."
"Tata Nexon EV is an innovative car, 5 stars crash rating safest, connected, 3 variants, the perfect car for sustainable mobility, good range, low maintenance, globally first A Benchmark!"
"Tata Nexon EV is a nice car. It cost cutter but the charging stations are limited so they can use only on a city daily basis, can't use and take to another city."
"Superb car, pollution-free, best think if the car is fully charged than car run 300 to 400km . I think this is best, but the only the problem we are facing that is changing point stations, a government think about this, provide this facility at all petrol pump stations."
I got this car last week and I am amazed at its performance. The response time is excellent range per full charge is around 200km within the city.
It is a good car with great safety features and good Colour combination. It is a complete product.
"This is the best car in the segment..I'm proud to be its owner. It is the best car in safety, features, mileage, quality, body, and price... I'm proud of tata Motors. The best Indian car manufacturing company... Everyone having the budget to buy this car should never lose the chance to buy it... I personally appreciate this car.and advice to m..."
 Its amazing car with amazing features. It is an affordable car with nice performance.
Very good car for all the people who take this car and enjoy. Our family to take. This car is very expensive for the Tata family.
"Everything about this car is very appealing, the looks performance and ergonomics. Tata is growing very fast in this segment. The new sharp edge front looks are more attractive than the curvy look it had before. The 30 KW battery is sufficient for city drive but there should have been a higher variant with 50Kw battery to cover up the range anxiety..."
"Car bang for the price. ARAI claim 312km per full charge, after a lot of research I found real-world range is 193km, a good driver will get 240km max. This car is good for city drivers and one-day outing, the long journey definitely doubtful. You can't charge every 3 hours once. It's bit irritating. But cost per km 0.50paisa to 1.2Rs/km. It's ..."
It's a very nice car with amazing features.
"Nice car, I would rather say very silent, very powerful. Tata has done a nice job, to promote electric vehicles, without compromising power output. There are many rivals as well but it would be unbeatable. This car charges from 0% to 80% in just 60 minutes and runs for 312 km with an impressive top speed of 140km /h. I recommend it if you go for an..."
"I just really like this product. I want to buy the tata Nexon EV, luxury plus. We are trusting on Tata"
I like this car's safety and comfort and the design is impressive and I prefer all the people to buy this car because at this price. Tata brings the car at electric version and its design at this price is impressive.
"Nice best car for Indian market as well as Indian roads, so I expect more from this car in the future."
"This is a futuristic car. Great looks, awesome mileage and no need to stand in the queue to get petrol, Diesel or CNG. Say no to pollution and do your contribution to decreasing pollution. "
"I have booked one, yet to be delivered to me at Bhubaneswar. It's early days to have the cons but real pros are 1. Affordable range nearly 220-240 in reality. 2. Effective run cost Rs1/KM. 3. Price is aggressively kept under 15 lakhs, so subsidy from the state and central Gov't. 4. Almost no maintenance and service cost. 5. Ample cabin space and gr..."
Excellent and safest and cheaper car in comparison to other cars of its size. Tata has worked very hard from a couple of years in bringing class. 
"Tata Nexon EV Is best budget SUV Car In India, It comes with 35 connected features and It has got silent and smooth drive features but I only love Its Z connect technology on Nexon so Overall Its affordable electric car."
Best EV in the country considering the relatively affordable price tag. Undercuts the MG ZS price by more than 5 lakhs.
The car is very attractive and muscular.
This new vehicle can change the entire market. Soon all the competitors will fall into it and we will get enhanced versions each year. Nice startup Tata hopes your Nexon will get most EV sales. I think that the battery has some risk for some mishaps. Like a single leakage in battery or any accident can turn into blast hope they have taken care of i...
The car is great . Its legroom and ground clearance is also good.  
Tata is the best company in the world Tata Nexon EV is an electric vehicle I like the feature and all over the performance of the car.
"Affordable price and nice looks, beautiful smart features most styling and new look multi-drive mode, silent car no noise and vibration in an electric car, projector headlamp, three-color desk board, Rear Ac, auto Ac, Harman infotainment system touch screen, ABS, EBD, CSC these are standard safety features in this car."
"It's an awesome car with every built-in feature specially the safety ratings are too good may be the first car in is a segment to reach 5 stars and in this EV version, it's going to beat everyone under TATA logo. With this much torque and power in the electric version, it's going to catch eyes of the buyers and also environment-friendly. With a new..."
"Best SUV in this segment. I am really happy to have this car, my family vehicle and it's the best thing."
"No one can compete with TATA, TATA is best in everything compared with other companies in all feature and mainly rates, Tata car is safer compared to other companies' cars in accidents also."
"It's look is like a giant legend and features are alike. So many companies are launching and trying to launch electric version with similar features and even more as Tata Motors does but still, they are lagging behind Tata Motors in price, features, timing of introduction, when it is much needed, battery strength that to at such primitive stage and..."
"Very excited for the launch of Tata Nexon EV. Since many years I have been waiting for an Indian Electric car and I think Tata will accomplish my dream. The best thing that I liked about it, is it can be charged with any 15 Ampere plug and can run up to 270 KM. That's cool! Another thing that I liked is that electric technology is coming in Ta..."
We can see Tata Motors progress. Keep it up. Tata Nexon is India's first Safest Car. I liked the features of the car.
