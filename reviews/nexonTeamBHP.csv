Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"I bought 2 Nexon EVs approximately 20 days back. Both are top of the line variants. These were bought in Mumbai via Puneet Motors.

Reason for EVs - Post Coronavirus, we were spending approximately Rs. 60000 per month on fuel for the Car which picks & drops my colleagues. We figured that if we sell our older cars (Tata Safari Storme VX 4x4 1st Gen and Volkswagen Jetta 1st Gen), our EMIs plus cost of charging will be equal to the amount we're spending on fuel for just 1 car.

Reason for choosing Nexon - We heard that one of the popular international Korean EVs available in India requires a 3-Phase electric connection to charge the car, which makes it a problem at my home. Another British brand, (now Chinese owned) EV had a louder motor sound, though the range and acceleration were awesome. The only Indian competitor had slightly lesser range. We assumed incorrectly that we would be able to do Mumbai-Pune-Mumbai on a single charge if we went with Nexon EV.

Having owned a Tata before, I assumed that I'm aware of all the niggles we face with Tata. Boy, I was wrong! I will keep this review as unbiased as possible, however certain amount of bias may creep up because of my horrible buying experience (omitted from this post). I am non technical when it comes to automobiles, and I'm too technical when it comes to computing systems, software and electronics. Do consider this as a layperson's review of the automobile bit. I do not understand concepts like ""The steering is heavy (my 1st Gen i10)"" or ""Corners well (my 1st Gen Honda City)"", etc. I have driven a total of approximately 8 lac kms in 20+ years.


The Good
-----------
1) This car is silent. The only thing you can hear is the AC, Wipers, and if AC and wipers are switched off, the motor which turns the wheels in any direction. I'm assuming this is a drive by wire, because you can hear the motor turning the wheels. Also there's almost no feedback on the steering wheel.

My colleague who has the taken the other Nexon EV now find his Mercedes ML250 too NOISY. And that's how our organisation's field workers now travel by Mercedes and Directors in a Nexon

The whole point of spending less on fuel is lost

2) The car has some serious real-time pull to it. This is the first thing any ICE car owner would notice. There's a certain latency (lag) to when you press the accelerator on ANY ICE car (be it BMW, Marcedes, SUV, Sedan, Hatchback, Indian, Japanese, Korean). There's like a few milliseconds to when these cars react to you hitting the gas pedal.

EVs (We test drove others as well) in general are INSTANTANEOUS. This makes it a pleasure to drive and you can weave through traffic like there's no tomorrow.

Nexon EV in sports mode accelerates so fast that your soul gets left behind. I can't even imagine what a Tesla (>twice the acceleration) would feel like.

3) The car is comfortable, for tall people too. I'm 5'6"" and had a few tall friends drive it around. They said it was very comfortable. Perhaps they didn't want to give negative feedback, but I think the rear leg-room could be a tad bit better. However, seats are really good, AC perfect, car is silent, shock-ups feel great on bad monsoon roads too (Karjat, Khopoli, Uran).

We don't have people driving us around, but for those who do - they may not buy this car. But for me and my family, I'm ok with it.

4) Brakes are brilliant. This was the first thing I tested as I'm very unhappy with my parents 2018 Honda Jazz CVT when it comes to braking at higher speeds

5) Display panel (speedometer, regenerative braking, battery, etc.) is informative and very useful. Range on display is as humongous a lie as Google maps waali aunty. But one gets used to it.

6) Portable charger is a charm! They should have made it at least 5 metres longer, but ok.

7) This car teaches you driving manners. Although I did say you can weave through traffic and the pick up is great, I find that I have become a better driver in the past 2 weeks. I break efficiently to save battery, I do not change lanes as often and I do not hit the ""gas?"" pedal as much either. Nor do I try to pass the traffic signal when it is going from Orange to Red.

8) Battery warranty makes this EV a net positive IRR purchase as compared to ICE. 1.6 Lac kms or 8 years! This shows as much confidence the engineers have in the product, as Apple did when making their first phone without replaceable batteries.

9) Running + maintenance costs. <Rs 1.5 per km. As of now servicing costs <Rs 2000 about twice a year. And there's nothing to maintain.


The BAD
----------

1) Lights. In general I've not liked lights in many vehicles that I've driven except for ML250 and 1st Gen Honda city. So yeah, this may be a personal choice of mine.

2) Manual is incomplete. 4 settings for light, manual has only 3 listed. Same for wipers. Plus a few other bits are missing or wrongly attributed to the EV, don't remember which ones.

3) Fit and finish - I expected this from Tata (or other Indian brands), so no complaints for me but listing it here for finicky people.

4) The guys who were supposed to turn up for installing my charger at home haven't turned up (in 20 days???). After repeated calls. But again, this is something we have come to expect of Tata (Tata Power in this case as they've been outsourced this work by Tata Motors)

5) One of the Fog lamps not working on both the EVs and had to be set straight after sending to the showroom/workshop.

6) DC Fast charging is not recommended frequently. So for every 4 DC fast charges (20 mins advertised), you have to have at least 1 slow charge (practically 8 hours to 10 hours). Theoretically, this makes driving to Delhi from Mumbai impossible (If one had charging stations along the way)

7) This car can not handle water. Manual says not to go in 30+ cm (1 feet) of water. Workshop people were a bit scared delivering the vehicle to us on a rainy day. Why are we calling this an SUV again? Can we call it a mobile phone please? IP whatever my hairy bottom.

8) Manual says battery WILL degrade to 70% later and this is to be expected. So our range takes a big hit.

9) Real world range is different for both EVs (prior to point 2 in ugly). One is ~240 kms, the other is ~220 kms. Same guy driving (me). Everyday travel from Vashi to Belapur on Palm beach Road and back in average traffic conditions. I've figured places with speed breakers etc. will give lesser range. Traffic will reduce range further. I am tired of following up with overworked people from Tata Motors and hence have not pointed this out to Tata. Plus Indian companies in general do not appreciate feedback. Any feedback will probably get lost in annals of archived email chains.

Also I have an untested theory. When I charge my car at my parent's place, the range is lesser. When I charge it at my work place, the range is more. Quality of electricity perhaps?

The Ugly
----------

I like to joke that ever since Ferrari have partnered TCS, it's been downhill for them in F1.

Another joke:
Bill Gates: If GM had kept up with the technology like the computer industry has, we would all be driving $25.00 cars that got 1,000 miles to the gallon
CEO of GM: But who would want a car that crashes twice a day?

Although Snopes says the above exchange is false, I'd say it is so close to the truth. Here are my reasons why.

1) The display on my EV started slowing down (The animation of speedometer, brake regen, gear change, etc.). This started behaving like I was running Windows ME on an old 386. Then while driving the display rebooted It started working fine after that. Soon we'll start buying NVIDIA GPUs for our cars too. Software Gore.

2) My colleague's EV when sent to workshop (point 5 in Bad) had it's software updated. Now his EV behaves differently while leaving the ""gas?"" pedal. Earlier it used to immediately go in regen mode, now it doesn't. Software Gore.

3) My colleagues EV was permanently stuck in ""Crawl back mode"" and had to be sent to the workshop. Crawl back engages when battery is below 10% and is very low performance mode to save on battery. This crawl used to appear when the car felt moody. Software Gore.

4) The heavily advertised phone app, what I call Gizmogiri - ULTRABAD. Sometimes it connects, sometimes doesn't. You can theoretically start AC ""x"" minutes before you reach your car. You can theoretically lock/unlock your car from your phone. You can become the Prime freaking minister of India. But there's a difference between what you can, and what does happen. Software gore.

5) Rain sensing wipers have a mind of their own. They are SO FAST in low rain and SLOW in heavy rain. I don't think it's the sensors, it definitely is... you got that right, didn't ya? Software Gore.

What are we to expect when these guys start pushing OTA updates? A buffer overflow will make me get into an accident. Why is this car 5* safety rated? You know how big the Linux or Windows kernel (The very core, not the whole OS) are? 30+ million lines of code. That dear friends is called software bloat. Over the years more and more stuff keeps getting added to this existing rotten bloat. We are living in a dystopia where our toasters and washing machines also need to connect to the Internet. Do you want your car to get outdated every 3 years? Too many questions.

Come on folks! Do you use smartphones and laptops? Every wonder how you have come to accept certain irritating bits of software gore? You want your cars to be added to the list as well? For me the answer is a BIG NO."

Thanks for sharing this very unbiased review as an owner of the Nexon EV. I've become a fan of EVs after driving the best of them. My detailed article is at this link (Electric Cars...through the eyes of a diehard petrol-head).

Sucks to hear about the issues you are facing so early in your car's life. If anything, the problems will only get severe as the car ages. My golden rule with Tata & Mahindra is to never buy v1 of anything they make. Even in a conventional ICE car like the Harrier, the 2019 build had so many issues, while the 2020 still has some of them (a BHPian owner recently reported electrical gremlins in his '20 Harrier & water leakage).

Either way, I do hope things improve and Tata starts fixing the cars of early adopters like yourself. You all have taken a leap of faith with the Nexon EV & Tata had better pamper you guys.

Thanks again for sharing! Your thread will go to our homepage on Monday ."

re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"I'm very tempted to consider the Nexon EV as our first electric car. It's got good specs (129 PS, 245 Nm & a 30.2 kWh battery pack) and is much more affordable than the other two proper electrics (ZS EV & Kona) in the market today. The Tigor EV and e-Verito are simply half-baked products that give a bad name to electric cars. The mid XZ+ variant of the Nexon EV @ 14.99 lacs ex-showroom is especially good value-for-money.

I assumed that since it's an electric and has much fewer moving parts, it would also have much fewer problems compared to a regular ICE car. However, your review has brought to the fore software gremlins that I was not aware of - thank you so much for shedding light on this!

I'm not going to be rushing out to buy the Nexon EV anytime soon. Due to the lack of affordable EV options in the market today, it's still at the top of my EV list, but I'd rather adopt a wait & watch approach to see if these things are sorted out by Tata.

The 6 month service interval sucks in my opinion! I see no reason why it should not be 1 year, as there are very little regular maintenance items compared to an internal combustion engined car."

"Electric cars using Li ion batteries won't solve any pollution problem in the next 50 years.

It is sad that the Nexon EV has so many QC issues. Is there a group, and have you been in touch with them? Some of the reports here are very positive. It'd be good if the owners speak up if he car dies. EV ownership in India will be dictated by practical considerations and if the tata folks don't provide the range they describe, it's a shame. Same goes for Kona and MG."

re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"From the thread title, I was expecting something devastatingly wrong but I am relieved to see it is primarily the inadequate range that seems to be #1 downer. Other niggles will get sorted out.

There is an ownership review of Kona on the forum. The car is in Pune and the owner has done a couple Pune Mumbai Pune return trips on single charge. Also a few Pune Nashik one way trips on single change.

I have driven all 3 - Kona EV, ZS EV and Nexon EV. All are fast all are silent (the ZS EV I drove did not have any unsusually high motor noise). From the specs it's pretty clear that for longer range, Kona and ZS EV are better buys and if it's just local city usage, Nexon EV will be a good option as it's much cheaper.

BTW, just curious, what is the apprehension in naming the Kona and ZS EV in your description?"
""
re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"I think it was always a bit optimistic to expect the Nexon EV to do Mumbai-Pune-Mumbai on one charge. There is enough real world data available in public domain that suggests that the Nexon doesn’t have enough range and that the Kona can do it if driven sedately. ARAI range has to be taken just like how we take ARAI certified mileage figures - with a bit of salt.

Honestly, I find the 220-240km range very very reasonable for the battery capacity. Some owners are getting only 170-200km tops. If the car is able to maintain it for a good 5 years without any significant degradation, it is job well done for Tata’s engineering teams.

The software and connected tech related issues seems to be everyone’s Achilles heel. Even the Seltos is plagued by these. Tata needs to make sure this is taken care of. Basic utility of the car, it’s driving experience and it’s range cannot behave randomly.

Automatic wipers have been a pain point on my Hexa as well. They have NEVER worked as expected. Sometimes too slow, sometimes too fast, sometimes the wiper just doesn’t start. TASS can’t get it work properly either. I have to use it manually, and that gets irritating sometimes because there is no intermittent mode."

Try not to fast charge too much as fast charging cause Lithium Batteries to heat up more and heating reduces its life. Of course you are guarded by the 8 year warranty but you may have reduced range problem to deal with in the interim until you reach the stage where the threshold range is reached that entitles you for the replacement.

Regarding variable car ranges on the place of charge, are you charging at office during daytime and parent's place during night time? If yes, the reason can be commercial consumers going low on usage from late evening which ends up increasing voltage to the other consumers (households). Of course there can be other reasons for higher voltage like proximity to the booster station or the transformer in the locality, etc but in general during night times power quality becomes better actually owing to lesser devices which are responsible for sending noises back to the powerline.

You should observe the voltage level if possible with a multimeter to draw a conclusion or otherwise the charging time. If the charging time is lesser to reach 100% at your parents place you know where to look for, try charging during the day and observe the difference.

In general these battery chargers charge with a constant current and keeps sampling the rising battery voltage to ascertain a certain threshold being reached before switching over to constant voltage resulting in trickle charging eventually towards the end. A good charger should be able to handle the powerline noise and voltage fluctuations within a certain tolerance that can otherwise end up impacting the current or voltage levels used to charge the battery. Probably in this case the charger is cutting off voltage and showing 100% as soon as a threshold voltage is reached while it should carry on charging for some more time, may be you can disconnect the charger from mains and reconnect after 2 minutes to check if the charging resumes. You may also try charging at s commercial charging outlet to see any differences."

This is a hit & miss, my installation went smoothly, and pretty much it's nothing but a 16A socket with MCB attached to it.

Unfortunately, this is a problem as of now. DC Fast charging heats up the batteries and can have adverse affects on chemistry. I had done two fast charges initially for my car spread over weeks. It still had some issues with it.

I guess people have apprehensions about the claim, the battery is IP67 rated and so are many of the components. However, it is not meant to be used as an offroader and driven in a stream.

This is true for all batteries, some tesla owners (those who can truly claim they have had more than 5 to 8 years of usage) still have good range so it is not going to be a drop of the cliff in terms of degradation. At this point, we do not have data to say anything about the nexon. Then again with the battery tech changing so fast, and with solid state batteries on the horizon, it might be as simple as swapping the battery with the car. The Car is still good and will be so far many years to come.

Did you actually hit 240 or 220? or is it that projected after the DTE left before you charged your car. Getting 200+ seems to be a task for many of the owners!

----------
2) My colleague's EV when sent to workshop (point 5 in Bad) had it's software updated. Now his EV behaves differently while leaving the ""gas?"" pedal. Earlier it used to immediately go in regen mode, now it doesn't. Software Gore.
This is as intended, the changed the regen in 2.07 based on user feed back, to allow more cruise in the highway. Imagine you are at 80kph on highway, and just lift the pedal, it will start braking and can have dangerous consequences if there is a vehicle tailgating you. Coasting will lead you to more range than regen ever will.

3) My colleagues EV was permanently stuck in ""Crawl back mode"" and had to be sent to the workshop. Crawl back engages when battery is below 10% and is very low performance mode to save on battery. This crawl used to appear when the car felt moody. Software Gore.
This can also trigger if the system ""deems"" that there is an issue with electricals. It can be wonky (it's the same in Ather scooter aswell) but it does provide a fail safe.

I agree with you on this 100%, in the initial stage, only lock/unlock worked and it was meant to be that way it seems. Only after the patch they are unlocking the other features. Even OTA is not enabled now. At this point, the only connected feature which works reliable is the location of the car and intrusion detection/warning."

"So in the latest s/w regen is switched off?
Why can't Tata provide adjustable regen lile Kona and eZS?"
""
re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"it's not switched off, the regen has been toned down a bit. It was ludicrous to have such strong regen to begin with. The way it now works is perfect, if you are at high speed and lift your foot, then regen is not so aggressive. If you are at 40ish and lift your foot, the regen starts a bit stronger but still not that aggressive. Once you hit your foot on brake the regen is aggressive.

It would have been good to have adjustable setting but the provision isn't there through hardware control like the Kona's paddle shift. However, in future, we can see it through software maybe."
""
re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"Some proper research would have helped if range was an issue. At this point, an EV in India should only be for intra city commute. We will have to wait till 2030 to have a proper infrastructure that will support inter city travels above 500 km and fast recharges. How often does one travel 500km is a big question mark. I haven’t traveled 500km a day in a car in a decade, I take a train mostly and if more than 500 kms a flight. The use case scenario for 95% of people would be less than 100kms daily. Others should stay away from EV for the time being. Even those buying EV should accept that they are taking a giant leap of faith and that too of a technology that’s in its nascent stage. Imagine buying the first mobile phone from Motorola! So keep expectations to a lower level and don’t compare with ICE cars which have been here for a century."

How does the battery warranty treat range degradation? Is there a certain percentage of the original range at which the battery will be considered faulty and be replaced?

If not, I would gravely doubt how much testing has been done to ensure a range that does not deplete rapidly with time."

The car can handle water very well, infact better than an ICE powered car.
In this case, the fault lies in dealer training, and Tata Motors should take full blame for that

In fact, when we were brainstorming about the experience drives for potential customers of the Nexon EV, one of seriously considered ideas was to demonstrate the water-wading capability of the vehicle specifically to allay the apprehensions about water and EVs.

re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"Congratulations on your EV. It is a great vehicle with its usual Tata niggles. I wish Tata came up with a different vehicle instead of using Nexon, some fresh SUV design to distinguish it from existing Nexon's. I really hate the over-styled rear of nexon. Maybe a Creta competitor with EV would have been a killer.

I toyed with EV concept but my father was totally against it, his logic was ""Never buy any new technology vehicles from any manufacturer, always wait for Version 3 or 4"". I tend to agree with him as I am facing issues with my TUV AMT. I will patiently wait for another 2-3 years before I jump on EV wagon. My usage after Covid situation will be daily 62 kms travel and once in a month 150 kms to my hometown and 150 kms back to city. Nexon EV in its current form fits my requirements perfectly, but like I said only Version 3 or 4."
re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"I just purchased a Nexon EV on 1 st day of this month and had driven it 400 Kms until now.
Till date no problems faced and the vehicle is perfectly fine giving a range 200-210 Kms . It's my first EV and have to admit it that it's impressive.
Will keep updated everybody as things progress."

This seems to be a real problem. Even moderate rain for sometime may cause one feet water logging on many Indian roads.

This is my main concern to consider for an electric vehicle. I would wait until we have suitable range as well as adequate fast charging and battery swapping facilities available.

I have learned the same lesson. I bought TUV300 couple of months after launch and had to struggle for sometime to fix the niggles. Now I would wait for at least one year from launch of any vehicle to see real world reviews to make decision."

"More than the EV tech to be blamed, I feel majority of the problems stated are :

Tata's QC issues and
Connected features issues

Can empathise with the connected issues.
Especially for the manufacturers who are yet to get mechanical perfection or finesse, jumping in the whole connected thingy is just problems piled on problems.

Even basic ECU/ software gets messed up.
My uncle's KUV100 D had to have laptops plugged in and software updated and errors rectified within 10k kms.
Issue- Jerky fuel mapping.

My buddy's Harrier v1 gets updates and features added/removed with each service visits. Not to say the screen freezes and hangs.

So can expect the worse when OTA updates and connected features are being implemented, atleast for the initial 5-6 years in the budget end."

re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"For some reason I don’t find this review very convincing.
1 - No car, EV or otherwise will give the ‘claimed range’ anywhere in the world. Its like the Maggi 2 minute noodles (tried this everywhere even on a ship at sea and zero point and didn’t happen)
2 - it’s an EV driven by electronics and software what else did you expect? It’s like saying I bought a diesel locomotive and its bad because it needs oil and not water like a steam engine to run. I really don’t get this point.
3 - About your software reboot issue. I am sure there are redundancies built in. FYI most aircraft today are flown by software! It took them 20-25 years to perfect it.

re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
I have been living in the US for past 10 years but keep up with the Indian automobile industry including test drives whenever I go to India. EVs in general are new for traditional ICE manufacturers. My first EV here was a leased Ford Focus electric and it had all sorts of issues. I got a Bolt EV after that and we have been very happy with that. We recently bought a Model S and that made us realize why Tesla stock is worth investing in. It seems the auto manufacturers need to pivot to software first as that is a huge differentiator here. Eagerly looking forward to more EVs on Indian roads

re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"Thanks for posting the review, even if my conclusions based on what you (the OP) have posted is very different from the title of this post.

As GTO has mentioned, this is a first iteration of a Tata product - and some niggles are bound to be expected. Am sure Tata will eventually get the connected car technology going - but presume that it is not something that is essential to the product.

But when I look at your having achieved a 220-240 km real world range on Palm Beach Road, I have to say that is not bad at all by any standard. The Nexon EV has a quoted range of 312 km, so getting 70-77% of that in real world conditions with the AC on is very good given Indian driving conditions. A 220 km range would be enough for someone like me to manage a full week’s running - not bad at all.

The wading depth of 1 foot is also quite good - don’t think I would take my diesel cross over into more than 1 foot of water, and it is certainly not a deal breaker.

Am surprised you (the OP) expected to be able to do a Mumbai Pune Mumbai run on the EV given it’s quoted range. Even from Vashi, Pune is 134 km away - and you have a Ghat in between which is not the most efficient route for any kind of car.

At any rate, best of luck and hope you have many miles of efficient motoring with this car."

"The review is interesting and I really liked the way the OP has put humour into it, but at the same time I find it quite harsh. After going through the post meticulously, I find it as a mismatch of expectations and not a feedback of the car and definitely not a case against electric cars!

A few of the issues are really annoying for a new car owner and it should not have happened. I hope that Tata fixes these issues quickly.

Edit: The rain sensing wiper on my Range Rover Sport also has a mind of its own, but one can argue that it is a Tata product as well"

There might be software gremlins in other EVs as well. If not now, definitely when they install ""service pack 2"" or something similar. Large software corporations do not get their software right. Boeing has screwed up bigtime too and caused a few crashes.

And I don't like in general the direction this industry is going in. And definitely with Nexon, there are question marks.

But if you were referring to electricity generation using fossil fuels, I'll have to disagree there. It's far easier to change the power generation to renewables than to change millions of cars. EVs that way are a step in the right direction.

QC issues as of now with software mostly. The Sales guy from Tata Motors (not the dealership) is in touch with me. But I guess he's overwhelmed with the number of calls he takes a day. He sounds like a genuine guy who's concerned. I know Tata (Power & Motors) reads TeamBHP as I was contacted by a few people from the organisations after my initial post. If you are Reading this - Please give your Sales guy (Initials SN) a couple of assistants! He's an asset you'd like to have on your side.

I wasn't aware of the same prior to purchase. I'm sure many buyers of all EVs may not be aware either. In fact many buyer of ALL EVs are not going to be aware of real ranges too. I thought fast charging stations were the holy grail of EVs. You'll realise I made a case against all EVs and some in specific to Nexon.

For the benefit of others (correct me if I'm wrong), the way batteries are charged and discharged is by a chemical reaction which brings the batteries chemically into the state they were in when fully charged. Thumb rule - The faster the chemical reaction, the lesser efficient it is going to be and more heat it will generate.

If you're charging your car 80% in 20 mins that's actually a downer.

Agreed, I have a love-hate relationship with Tata. And my anger is more ""paternal"" for the lack of a better word. The car is still good. But battery tech will always be 'x' years away. I've been reading up about battery tech. It's like what they say about Graphene, same applies to battery tech in general. Graphene is wonderful and can do everything, except leave the lab.

You are right. I am an idiot. I did 22kms on 10% charge and multiplied. Also did ~12kms on 5% charge and multiplied. Don't remember the actual figures, but you get the point. I'll do a complete run on 95% consumption and post actual figures later.

NO!! How can they change something in a product which they've sold to me without explicit permission? And just when I was getting used to it? And my issues with bad software - Words like 2.07 have started creeping into our vocabulary already. This is exactly what I was talking about.

Coasting is good, I'm assuming when the green ""power"" bar doesn't illuminate is what you mean. That's how I get decent ranges even in moderate traffic. I accelarate and start coasting immediately. Hope I'm not getting the word wrong here.

Yup, the system has started ""deeming"" twice a day again, on my 2nd EV as well. I'm ok with wonky as long as I feel safe. I'm not ok with wonky if this raises question marks about battery management system (software). Undecided on this one.

Yes, they're frustrating. But they're honest people. 8 years warranty is something which made me buy this in the 1st place.

100% agreed. In case of Safari Storme, not many dealer technicians know how to ""Fix the light bulb"". My bulb was popping out time and again until a dealer tech fixed it for me. He said ""iska connector alag hai... kisiko malum nahi rehta kaise karne ka... mai fix karta hu, extra pressure se dabaane ka rehta hai""

I am unsure whether Tata software is good at managing their batteries and have stated my reasons for believing so.

And my opinion is that software is more important in EVs than ICE due to BMS. Perception that if you can't get Software A right, you aren't getting software B right is justified IMO.

Thank you for your objective and detailed rebuttal

1 - 2 min Noodles: ~250 kms with some juice left were being thrown around by sales reps (these figures are quoted even now for new buyers). And I wasn't aware of advisories against multiple fast charges. Yes, I was being stupid. But sometimes ""misleading"" also comes to mind as it should in case of noodles.
2 - Please refer to my answer to DicKy above
3 - Boeing has an ongoing case and it's far from perfect. Ex Boeing Engineers on various forums (anonymous I'll agree to that bit) also have a lot to say about the horrors there
4 - Please refer to my answer to DicKy above
4 - Wiper - I redact my statement. This was my 1st car with auto wipers and the only one I've driven much before this is my colleagues ML250. I simply did not know
5 - I've acknowledged the same. But why call this an SUV? My Storme took on all kinds of abuse and handled well. This doesn't. Why SUV? That's my point. Sorry, wasn't clear earlier
7 - I'll wait for others to post their experiences first. Sorry, just being cautious. Also, unsure how regular 6-7 DC charges impact warranty. I'm just following manufacturer advisory here.

TASS - TATA After Sales Service,
The forum is anything like reddit (and thank goodness for that) still pure from driven media propaganda. You will not be BANNED or MUTED for sharing your thoughts and inputs about any specific region based companies.

I do feel you, maybe you are from a field and thought process that looks for AI and ML is the future and current work you do and life you live give you the luxury to think about this. We all should however in REAL world (not saying yours is a fantasy, just an expression) people are still looking for gizmos on their cars than safety.
Sadly that translates to S/W as well, as it will make or break safety for coming generation of cars. A bad s/w experience on your 10-12 inch display can esasily distract anyone driving. Who knows going forward we might have S/W testing section in Global NCAP.

Imagine somebody getting into S/W development kits only for EV's. Any private player can look into this and I believe they will going forward.
TATA also has TCS, and for that I am hopeful their synergy of comapnies have the capacity to shine through. They have teams and R&D at their respective centres.

In the coming future it might and Thanks to owners like you and others who are sharing your feedback and pointing things out at the right time and space using the right medium. It might reach out to right eyes and ears.

Till then we are living with a quote I read or heard somewhere :
Har company ""LALA"" company hoti hai, farak intna hai Tere lala ka naam ""TATA"" hai , mere ka ""Mahindra"""
Re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"Hello Everyone,
Nice to see comprehensive review of the Nexon EV. I have been one of the early owners of the car although due to lockdown I had some delivery delays but I am also part of the nexon ev owners group we have. I think this thread seems to be right platform to give a practical overview of what has been happening with the car for most owners.

Positive Things:
The car has good road manners. It drives well and is stable.
The interiors and the infotainment are good for the price point.
Seating is comfortable.
Driving position is great.
Suspension is good and it handles bad road pretty well.
Points of Concern: (I deliberately do not want to call it negative things)
Range: The dealers and all tata marketing mechanism including social media claims the car will deliver 260-270 kms of real world range. However, the car cannot deliver anything more than 160-180 in real world driving conditions. Anyone who is able to extract 200-220 or so range either has to use it without AC or drive it at 50-60 kmph max. If you move with the traffic pace, 160-180 is the max on your lucky day. If you have 4 passengers on board, the range may fall further. You can only travel 60-70 far from your city safely in this car.
Marketing: Tata advertises the product as a go anywhere product. Their claims about worry free driving and no range anxiety seems completely untrue with such limited range. Cars are being sold like hot cakes due to such claims which in real world are not being delivered. Tata has product specialists which make hyped claims about the range but are clueless about the real limitations of the product. So actual usability limitations are never communicated to customers.
Fast Chargers: There are only a handful of fast chargers available in just a few cities. Tata Motors promise of setting up 700 fast chargers which they publicized in December 2019 (way before covid) is not a reality. Only Mumbai, Pune, Delhi, Hyderabad, Bangalore and Chennai owners are able to use fast chargers but with pathetic experiences. All the dealers where fast chargers are installed do not keep parking spaces available for EVs post business hours and the owners have to face arguments from the security guards if they were to use the fast chargers. Plus most of the times the fast chargers are dead and Tata Power is not even aware of them being dead.
Zconnect App: The app is a rookie attempt and mostly has been done just for the sake of advertising. Over the last few months of ownership, it has not been working consistently for anyone. Remote commands do not work, certain functions are disabled, trips go missing etc are just common problems.
Reliability: There has been a lot of reliability issues with the nexon evs for many owners. Brakes are being replaced, PDU has been replaced for some cars, there have been bms parts that have been replaced and random failures keep happening. Although, Tata claims the parts fail as counter measures to avoid complete failure however these things do not seem factual.
Software: EVs are mostly software driven products and so the perfect BMS (Battery Management Software) and VECU combination is needed for an efficient and consistent EV drive to work. Right now, the Nexon EV neither has any of this. It is a half baked product that has been pushed into the market and tata has been experimenting with software updates on actual sold cars. Most of the owners are not able to use the car to its full potential due to the issues the cars are having.
Dealership Experiences: This has always been the weakest part of owning Tata cars but with the Nexon EV the frustration is taken to another level. There are limited EV dealerships but the availability of EV trained staff is almost none. They are clueless about the SOPs that need to be followed for EV issues and owners are left at the mercy of their luck many times. My own car was driven 500+kms over a period of 4 days just for testing and to this date the issues reported have not been solved.
Most owners had approached Tata with their issues but could not get any appropriate feedback and so a collective effort was made to contact Tata leadership after which we could get a meeting with EV team at Tata Motors headed by Mr. Anand Kulkarni, We had a common issues presentation made and since then have been communication over reporting new issues and asking for updates on our reported issues. However, we have not been getting any productive response.

Bottom Lines:
The car is being marketed differently and in reality the facts are different. The car has very limited range and so almost unusable where there are no fast chargers available nearby.
Please do not go by the marketing material that Tata Motors is promoting. The claims made in the marketing material with regards to the range, connected features and go anywhere capability are all not true.
Please also do not trust the sweet words of the sales representatives. Ther are hundreds of owners who were sold the cars this way and now they see the car is not delivering what was promised.
Purchase this car only if you have experimental money to spend. Tata themselves are experimenting with the product and so it is not mature or market ready at all.."

I think this product works great for someone who has been an EV customer before and knows what to expect. I would never jump into an EV ever directly.

What i did was i had leased an E2O from Zoomcar ZapSubscribe since 2018. And we were able to drive it 26000 KM since then. Which is why I decided to take the jump and invest in something more comfortable and slightly longer range and return the Lease.

It depends on your lifestyle if this product is worth it. For us, We have a farm house about 50km away. And I do a lot of cycling as well. Most of the mileage was driving to Farm, Dropping and picking up visitors from airport, And driving to start points of cycle rides.

With Nexon ... I can drive to mysore, leave it for fast charging, climb the chamundi hills on the bicycle, have nice lunch and drive back. For cost of 300 Rupees in electricity. and 200 for food.

I can drive from my farm in hosur ... to top to Yercaud ... I know a property that has a charging point (15Amp one for their buggies). and Come back next day.

If this is not the right section to post. I hear there is a whatsapp group in bangalore for nexon EV owners. Very keen to join that. Can someone PM me the details on how to join ?"

Re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"Very informative article on the Nexon EV. I am considering to take the plunge with the EV soon. Although I am not completely convinced yet, this thread has been an eye opener on the falls claims made by Tata in their advertisement and this is not expected either.
I think speaking of India, one should really wait for at least 2 years from now for this tech to settle and deliver. Once Maruti enters in the competition, they will ensure to not only make it practical but also sustainable.
Since the batteries also are not yet manufactured in India yet, it will be interesting to see once that happens, how the overall costing is going to be impacted."
Re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"Don't have hope on Maruti, they rely on Suzuki for all their technical needs. Japanese makers are way behind everyone in EV and are betting on hydrogen. One can always wait for many years for the technology to improve in any field and keep waiting, Or you can take the plunge and enjoy EV now"

Re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"Here it goes again , another charge for the Nexon .
This time I have noted down the meter reading as well .
Charging at 478 kms on Odometer while charge remaining is 10 %.Electricity meter reads 292 KwH.
After overnight charging , now battery is at 100%, Range showing 190 kms (i regularly drive the Abarth Punto or the Forester for work .So for that kind of driving style i think it's ok .) and the units on electricity meter is showing 323 KwH.
That means 31 units have been consumed at night taking it to 100% charge from 10 %. Considering 7.25 Rs/Unit of costs , it charged fully at 224.75 Rupees. Now it will go 190 kms ,but again considering 10 % remaining charge at which range was 20 kms , will deduct those 20 kms so that the effective range becomes 170 kms .
Now overall cost per km comes at 225 rs/ 170 kms =1.32 Rs/km ."

"Kona owner here, and should say, well written review! Just curious about the point you made why you dropped the Kona from your shortlist. Was it only because of the 3-phase power requirement?

If yes, then you may have missed out because the Kona allows the owner to set the rate of charging from inside the car. This way, even people who have only single phase power can use a max of 3.2kW.

Another option available, you can ask for the wallbox charger to be programmed to charge at 3.2kW by default, and can increase it with the RFID tag as and when required.

Also, be happy you at least have rain sensing wipers, Hyundai hasn't bothered to provide this in the Kona, and even though I love my Kona, this is just one of the things where the Nexon scores over the it.

Very impressed with the Nexon, am considering buying it to replace my 7 year old e2o, once the niggles you mentioned (some of which are reported by many other owners) are ironed out of course."

"Anybody from North India specifically from UP who has got an EV ? any reviews? Should I go with the EV or not ?
The pulling factors are the performance, ease of driving and cost of ownership. However the repelling factors are no fast charging locations, range anxiety and comparatively untested technology."

"Hello Bhpians,
I own a 4 year old e20 plus and with time the requirements for a larger range vehicle woth better rode quality has risen. When i got the mahindra i got a whooping 1 lakh INR discount with out much bargaining. The model was just a month old with no manufacturing faults etc. THE BEST PART IS I GOT THE INFO TO ASK FOR SUCH A DISCOUNT, FROM WHERE ELSE BUT TEAM-BHP. Now that i am keen to replace the mahi with a TATA, would anyone of u suggest me to go down a similar path? Or just accept what is offered. Thanks in advance"

"What a fantastic thread this not just for the OP’s perspective but also the counterviews from so many knowledgeable members.

I hope the OP posts regular updates on his ownership experience over an extended period. Look forward to a longer term ownership review of the EV via this thread."

I think this thread seems to be right platform to give a practical overview of what has been happening with the car for most owners.

I have zero range anxiety. I plan to drive the car primarily in Sport mode and I'll be happy if it can run reliably for a hundred kilometres in a day. I'll likely have to charge it once a week if it has a range anywhere close to 200 kilometres per charge.

However, the other issues you've mentioned are seriously making me reconsider purchasing this car. I was able to pull the trigger on it, and now you've gone and confused me.

Isn't it clear to you after reading this thread why Hyundai does not provide rain sensing wipers on its cars? I have a Ford EcoSport and the automatic wipers are terrible, and it would seem from this thread that this experience is shared by others with vehicles of all stripes. I think the conclusion should be that Hyundai is wise to avoid the technology altogether."

There is an update on the situation. For all prospective buyers, it is advisable to wait right now. We as owners are currently facing a huge safety issue with the car. We have been behind TML to issue a safety advisory to all the owners about this issue but that demand has been ignored even though our life is at risk due to this serious fault demonstrated by the cars. So basically here are some details on what the issue is.

We had reported certain range and reliability issues with the car which can be seen on the official nexonevgroup youtube channel. After constant follow-up TML released something called a 2.0 update which was a combination of BMS, VCU, AC calibration, and Telematics updates. They had earlier denied all of these issues but then they had to relent to the proofs provided by the owners. Since this update, a good percentage of the current owners have experienced a huge safety issue. What is happening is that the cars are switching to neutral i.e N mode during driving from the drive (D mode) without any warning or notification. This happens during traffic and so there is a sudden loss of speed on the cars and with traffic coming behind there is a chance of someone ramming into you from behind. There have been incidents where people have to go into accidents due to the issue. The car is not only unsafe for the occupants this way but also unsafe for the public because they are caught unaware when driving behind the car. We have been reporting this issue to TML for more than 50 days now and there has not been any fix out for this issue yet. They have yet not confirmed the cause of this behavior demonstrated by the cars as well. So for people looking to buy the car right now, we as owners would like to advise you to wait for the issue to be resolved. Long term reliability is still in question even for us.

I am not sure if posting direct youtube video links are allowed or not but there are many videos people have uploaded which show this issue."

4000+ Kms and touchwood have not faced anything like this yet. Is there a particular scenario when this happens, other than slow moving traffic like you had mentioned?"

The issue is completely random but has been happening on many cars. There have been videos made about it.

An example :

Mods ( please remove the youtube link if it is not permitted )

Please search ""Found Major Problem in Brand New Tata Nexon EV"" if anyone wants to search for the video which describes the problem in case the direct link is moderated.

Also, Tata Motors has officially accepted the issue recently."

+1 to that, haven't faced something like that.

Had checked with the SA during booking and they mentioned they had resolved it in production by providing better sealed connectors and under body plate covering that part."
Re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"Good perspective on both good and bad.

I'm also looking to buy the Nexon EV. Loved the Test Drive and now looking what are the risks apart from Range Anxiety and Fast Charging infrastructure.

I do not have a closed parking. Will that be a problem.

Also I understand that Maharashtra is giving 1L subsidy for the the first 10000 EVs. https://evreporter.com/maharashtra-ev-policy/

Has Maharashtra done the first 10000?"

"I park my car outside and underneath a tree, other than dried leaves falling, and birds pooping, I don't see it as a problem

The range anxiety will go away after a week, and FC infrastructure is happening. This is just the start, dive into the revolution and enjoy blissful driving."

Re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
"Ok, so I just bought one (XZ+) and personally, I don't think the XZ+ trim in particular is worth it.

This was in Greater Noida, a dealership called Sagar Motors.

We went to the dealership on the 20th of Jan to see the car. They had none available. But they were quick to tell us that it's exactly the same as the petrol variant they had available (spoiler: it's not). We were to exchange our 2010 Chevrolet Beat. So basically, we never saw the car, never drove the car, but they pressured us to book it anyway based on a false promise. They even had a brochure available that said that the car had rear armrest, headrest and wearable PEPS key available in the XZ+ time. So we booked it, because our Beat was getting cranky with age (would kill the engine as soon as you press the clutch to disconnect the engine even if it's just for up/down shifting). Come 23rd of Jan, I read two pieces of news:

Tata Motors increases prices of cars, SUVs by up to ₹26,000

An exchange bonus of Rs.15,000 is being offered on the purchasing the Nexon EV to celebrate it's one year anniversary

When I contacted him about these two, he promised to give me the extra 5k bonus (because initially he had promised us 10k only) as well as told me to not worry about the increased prices because the price increase was not going to affect anyone who had bought the car before 22nd of Jan, as per Tata. He also promised to deliver the car by 28th of Jan and get the charger installed 3 days before it (i.e. by 25th of Jan). After that, he went radio silent and we had to reach out to him by 27th, did all the paperwork but due to his incompetence, issues just kept cropping up that he somehow ""wasn't aware of"". I had been forcing him to arrange a test drive since day one but he always denied it saying there are no Nexon EVs available in all of Delhi NCR dealerships for me to drive (quite a claim!). On 28th, when our car finally arrived, he informed us he won't be letting us take the delivery until we have insurance finalized (which we were going to get from Edelweiss because Tata's was too expensive for a car like this). Then, he went back on his promise to give us the extra 5k bonus even though I showed him two other dealerships offering it. Then he tried to gaslight me by saying he would charge me the extra money on top of the agreed amount because of Tata's recent price increase (another broken promise). He gave us a test drive on that day with the demo car though (which had arrived on the same day as our car) and we found out that the car didn't have the rear headrest, rear armrest, wearable PEPS key. He also lied to us that the car does not have any sim even though I explicitly asked him about it because I had seen the mention of an e-sim in the infotainment system in a Youtube review. He had also promised us that we'd be able to charge our EV at his dealership for free, but on the 28th, he told us that his charger has somehow, miraculously broken and that he won't be able to install the charger at our place soon. So finally, yesterday, with an extremely bad taste in our mouths, we took the delivery of the car. The ""so called"" claimed range of 312 KMs was a lie too because at 99% charge, my Nexon shows ""180 Km"" which is depleting at a rate of about 1% every 2 kms and I have no way of charging it as of yet.

As you all may already know, last October, they had increased the prices of XZ+ (and XZ+ Lux) by 26k. Sometime after that, they basically took away the armrest, headrest and wearable PEPS key from the XZ+ package without adding anything back. And as of 22 Jan, they have increased the prices of all Nexon EVs (XZ+ has taken a hit of about 15k yet again). As you can see, the XZ+ is basically half a lakh more costlier now with it's feature list being constantly reduce and the reason for it probably is that this is the most popular trim; Tata may have let the early adopters have it at lower prices with good features but now they're either trying to make the Lux version sell more than XZ+ by depriving the XZ+ of even more features that Lux has or they're trying to cut corners on the manufacturing costs of XZ+ since they're the most ordered units. Either way, their dealerships are lying to the customers with a straight face telling everyone that the way cheaper ICE engine siblings, which have these extra features available at no extra cost, are the same as the EVs (respective trims) and promising range that even their own software refutes.

As it stands, I don't think anyone should by the EV's XZ+ trim. It's got more features missing from it than before but the price just keeps on shooting through the roof every couple of months for no good reason. If you absolutely must, go for an XM and install some TATA accessories or aftermarket stuff or if you have the budget, take the plunge and the Lux version since that one's got everything. XZ+, in my opinion, as of today, is just not worth it's price and I'm sure they'll just keep jacking these prices up."

Re: Ownership Review: Tata Nexon EV (1000 km)
I have seen few reviews mentioned the problem about Nexon EV misses the slot when put into a reverse gear and as a result the car does not go back when reversing and driver needs to put it to Neutral and then back into reverse. Did anyone experience this issue.
