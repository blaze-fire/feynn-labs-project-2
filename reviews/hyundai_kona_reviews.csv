reviews
"The car is really good. Excellent idea from the company. Prices are high, so please work on them. Make more products like these in a good range of price which is affordable for all. Reveal the car as soon as possible so the new generation of cars start and use of fuel vehicles are stooped."
"Superb car,  I like its designing full of features, good colour, fully-loaded car,"
An amazing car with best design and amazing looks available 
A nice car from Hyundai. Hyundai Kona is the best EV car which is Hyundai is launching eagerly waiting for it to take a drive.
This is an excellent car. The features are very impressive. The looks are really classic. 
Kona is a good car very interesting to know about it. I am proud that I am going to buy this. Good price because it is an electric car. It is an electric SUV.
The car offers reasonable performance in this range. I hope the price of the car is kept at or around Rs 20 lakh. It can be a very good option for those who drive around 12000 km a year with fewer outstation trips.
It's a great new for the Indian market. I hope the biggest problem of pollution in India will be sorted by Kona electric. Best suited for metro city and much more.
"Apart from all the online reviews my personal overall experience of Hyundai Kona was literally very amazing, from interior to exterior, from exploring to driving. Everything is perfect in this car and it provides amazing features at a very competitive price in the market right now. "
"Hyundai Kona electric car is very comfortable and secure but the electric range is very low, this car very expensive for a middle-class family. "
"Using it for the last 1 month. It's a gentle-looking beast. The pickup power is amazing. I tried 2 competitions cars in this segment. This is the best. Refined and well built, and superior performance. The Audio system is better than a premium car segment. The Bluetooth connectivity to stream all music from a phone, music a..."
"In the beginning, the car performed excellently well, but after 4 months the mileage on a full charge steadily reduced, and finally, it would not start at all. After paying a hefty amount for this car l am left without a vehicle and the Hyundai service people assured me that would send a replacement vehicle which they kept postponing with lame excu..."
"Battery life and its deterioration with time need to know, also the cost of battery replacement and any battery assessment tool of equipment. "
"Well, an electric car this is the tesla of India you can't go wrong with 400 hundred km charging no need for fuel just go on plug the car and at morning you have a full tank of gas."
This car would be the best selling car in India because of technology and design.
This is a very useful vehicle and non-polluting. The Hyundai Kona is a very modern car and stylish too.
"I bought this electric car 2 months back, driven 9900 kms until now. It runs 250 kms around with a single charge comfortably with AC on. Then u have to charge for complete peace of mind. Price high but u get 40% depreciation in your ITR for consecutive 4 years which means u haven't paid anything except for insurance and RTO. please make this car wi..."
Best car I have ever owned. A paradigm shift in the automotive sector. Easy to drive. Real-life range of 330km on a full charge.
Its new electric car of Hyundai fully loaded with features and best technology. Its seats are very comfortable too.
"Hyundai Kona is a gem of a car. It has all you can get out of a vehicle. power, balance while driving, comfort, fuel economy, reasonable maintenance, what more you need. First I would like to clarify that this review is entirely based on my experience with the vehicle. Being a mechanical and marine engineer, It was obvious that I had to do complete..."
"Hyundai Kona is a brilliant car! Love the driving experience. I am able to get 9.0 to 10.2km per k/h in the city. Traffic or no traffic, this car rocks. Eco mode works really well. The seat ventilations a great feature as well. Kona is a game-changer in India. Zero road tax and reduced insurance have made this car an absolute winner."
"Hyundai Kona - First electric car of India was REVA but it was a very compact two-seater car with very odd design, it failed because of lack of R&D by the company's team. But Hyundai Kona Electric is an elite vehicle and it will attract n number of customers. The charging station will boost the sales of Hyundai. Those who are habitual of a manu..."
The car is a bit high priced and great in its segment.
The car is high priced when compared with other cars of the same segment.
I swear the car is very smooth and quiet. The car has no maintenance because it is electric. And it has features like internet connectivity and other features that all the Hyundai cars have.
"The car is very expensive, the maintainence cost is very cheap when compared with electric vehicles."
In India first electric car I am so happy to buy this car. To control our environmental air pollution and everyone wants to encourage this electric car. I hope at the end of the 2020 year be the top-selling electric cars. Great ideas and innovations.
"Better than all diesel and petrol cars May be this will be the greatest achievement for Hyundai to launch the electric var in India. The price is a little more than fuel cars but according to me, it will be best SUV in India. We indians really need this type of stylish SUV in electric variant."

"Hyundai Kona is the 1st SUV to run in India with electricity. Its design is of another level just like a futuristic concept model. It's just smaller than Creta in size. But it looks big. Near the bonnet, we can see the long indicator below it is the led headlamp just like the venue. The grill is missing in this car as its an electric car it do..."
"Not worth the money, the price needs to come down for masses. Fast charging a must for anyone to buy."
Best Car. First Electric car in India. With the best features. I think it is better than other company's cars.
"Hyundai Kona is the best electric car, the pick up is just amazing."
This is the worst car in the segment. The features are not working properly. It is not a worthy car.
This is a wonderful car. The interior design is the best. The safety features are amazing.
Hyundai Kona is India's first electric SUV car. It is the right car for the environment and will be the best car in India.
"Wow, it is an excellent design, futuristic & innovative. But the price is pretty higher."
Hyundai is the best performing company beating all other vehicles. Hyundai is the first choice of people at present providing best services to its customers. Hyundai in electric segments of cars will beat all-electric cars of other companies and will set new level standards. It will be the first choice of people of New India.
