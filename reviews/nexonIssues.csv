Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"A few very serious quality issues of Nexon EV were mentioned in the Malayalam YouTube channel Talking Cars owned by Bhpians Vivek and JayDev.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1EgAHPJ13U


1. D to N Problem

Car shifts from D to N while running as a fail-safe measure. It’s not possible to change to D after D to N problem.
Company solution :
Nexon EV should be charged till 100% SOC and not to be stopped at 80 or 90%. Some owners were under the impression that their battery cycles would reduce if they charged regularly to 100%. so as a first step instructions were given to charge to 100% and once in 2-3 weeks take the SOC to lower than 20% and then charge to 100% to ensure BMS gets updated and balances the cells in a proper manner.
Also, a Software update was planned so that when the D to N happens, it would allow users to drive the car till their homes or a safer location and not get stranded suddenly on a highway or a secluded location..

2. SOC Dropping Regularly

There is team-bhp thread running on this issue. The charge of the battery suddenly drops in a matter of seconds.

Solution 1: In one case company downgraded the BMS software,

Solution 2. In another case company told that the recent update had done something to the battery. Speaking more technically, the cell voltage must be similar. The maximum and minimum cell voltage must be above of 3V; however, in this case maximum cell voltage was 3.3V and minimum was 1.2V. This resulted in battery imbalance. They have replaced the battery pack completely. However, the battery pack originally was from Sep2020. The replaced one is now from May2020 and REFURBISHED.

3. Fast charger getting stuck

Fast charger gets stuck and the owner has to access a release line below front wheel arch to release the charger.

4. Failure of mounts of electric motor in some cars

Mount of Motor fails and motor moves down.

Solution : An external black colour mount is provided as a temporary solution"

re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"All valid and serious failures but there are plenty of other issues effecting there Nexon Ev as well which are well documented on the owners group.

5) link rod replacement is required in a lot of vehicles

6) vehicle earthing fault causing the slow charger to show connected but not charging

7) boot lock failure is another one. Perhaps a Nexon wide issue rather than a EV specific failure

All of these issues and of course the ones mentioned above require SC visits and often it’s a battle against the customer and the SC advisor to try and prove the fault as they simply refuse to accept anything is wrong even if it’s shown to them.

My vehicle for example has been in and out at Durga Motors GOA SC for a week now coming up to 10 days and they keep sending it back without fixing any of the issues."

This happens to me when the voltage is low from the grid. Especially during night time when I guess grid is under load. The car starts charging in early hours automatically,. Till that time it shows connected but doesn't charge."

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"While still no excuse, it is a brand new technology, freshly baked and a totally new area for Tata Motors (along with most other carmakers). Hyundai faced many frustrating situations with the Kona, Audi struggled with the E-Tron in the early months & Tesla - the big daddy of them EVs - also has been through several teething issues.

If you are an early adopter buying v1 of a brand-new technology, be prepared to become an unofficial beta tester. Don't want that? Wait for 5 years or generation 2 / 3 of the tech."

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"The enthusiasm the Nexon EV has created among Indians for EV have increased the level of expectations. As GTO pointed out, certainly there will be teething issues for a completely new tech. It is some people (I am one of them) who would rather wait out till the next gens of most first gen EVs are out. Since many of us would be buying the vehicle as a primary and single family vehicle, it is rather difficult to live with frequent niggles. But I’m sure Tata will sort these out in a year or couple of years time."

"Agree with GTO. These issues are to be expected on a generation 1 technology. Touch wood so far my ownership experience of a Nexon EV has been trouble free and I absolutely love the experience of driving a EV. Driving is actually very relaxing with such next to no noise. On a side note, the Nexon EV owners group on whatsapp are actually very active and very good at helping owners when they run into issues."

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"Tata's regularly do R&D after releasing cars in the market right from the Gen 1 Indica. And still common people get fooled by them. I agree that other car manufacturers also face issues when new technology is being introduced. But Tata's are special in that even after 2nd or 3rd iterations also problems don't get fixed.

My heart goes out to the enthusiastic people who wanted to support EV technology. One needs to watch and wait and see how Tata's handle these glitches. They need to fully fix and make the ownership experience for the EV customers as great as possible. I hope that Tata's do this diligently.

As an early adopter myself.. It’s not the issues popping up that are the worry or even the complaint.

It’s the complete lack of care and almost disdain at having to do some work shown by most of Tata Service centre staff and the general attitude of the customer is always wrong and doesn’t deserve their issues rectified that is disappointing.

Hopefully you don’t have any issues come up with your new vehicle. I too had enjoyed a wonderful 15000km relatively trouble free. Now my vehicle spends more time at the SC then at home."

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"Can't say I am surprised. It's TATA being TATA and now they have also contracted the Lucas Industries bug from JLR.

Jokes aside, TaMo has tired to retrofit an ICE platform for EV and probably didn't do enough testing before rushing to the market hoping to make a mark in the emerging EV segment before its too late. 'Agile' might work for TCS but it won't work for TaMo."

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"Mods anyway we can add a poll to this post so members with the Nexon ev can vote on the problems they have had?

I am all for bashing a car maker for not looking after interests of its consumers but we should have numbers to substantiate it. I would for one be curious to see what kind of numbers we are looking at even if its a small subset of users that is TeamBHP users."

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
I wonder if it is due to the myopic view of the product manager or designer that came up with the specifications of expecting users to charge to a 100% all the time. I was reading a Kona owner’s long drive through Tamil Nadu and he was cribbing about a Nexon owner wanting to charge to a 100% on a fast charger. It appears that the BMS is basic and doesn’t handle real world charging and usage scenarios. This was the same problem that we faced on the Mahindra E2O. I hope Tata gets their act straight and makes the BMS handle non ideal real world scenarios soon.

Anand Kulkarni clearly mentioned in the interview with PluginIndia that Nexon EV should be charged to 100% once every fortnight on a slow charger. The car has passive cell balancing, so slow charging to 100% helps with making sure all cells have equal charge. This is not unique to Nexon EV or Tata Motors, but the same is recommended for my Tesla as well. Earlier people use to only charge their Teslas up to 80% on regular basis, but this led to car BMS thinking that the capacity of the battery is limited to 80% and people started to see range drop. Later Elon tweeted that the car needs to be charged to full 100% for the BMS to recognize the total capacity. So no Tata doesn't ask users to charge their cars to 100% all the time. It is a myth that some Non-Nexon EV owners keep floating around.

Secondly, it is common behavior among new EV owners to charge their car to 100% when they go on a trip. The fear of range anxiety makes them go that route, but once they start developing confidence and understand the car properly, they switch over to topping up method. This is not unique to Indians or Nexon EV owners, but people in US use to do the same. In fact even today first time EV owners do the same here in US.
Take it as if you take a trip to Leh-Ladakh-Spiti, people who are new or doesn't want to take the risk will fuel up their cars to full because they are worried that they might not find a fuel pump ahead."

It's mentioned in the Nexon EV owners manual that charging to 100% everytime is recommended , not sure if it's to be done while fast charging too."

Fast Charging to 100% should only be done if you feel you won't be able to make it to your destination with anything less than that. Excessive fast charging degrades the battery much more compared to slow charging.
I will take Anand's word of charging the battery to full 100 with slow charging once every two weeks, unless you need the extra range. They are getting data and based on that they can provide much more updated information. Won't rely on manual that much as it is from early days when Nexon EV was new to public.

They didn't even update the manual of the car for my Dark Edition EV which comes with TPMS. I had to reach out to dealership about it and then they sent me an additional booklet seperate from manual that mentioned the updated features."

Do non dark edition versions have it? I couldn’t find it on the website either. Or was it only introduced for dark edition?"

It was introduced in Dark Editions and if I remember correctly it was available only in Dark XZ+ Lux. The regular ones don't get it.
Also it's not like an active TPMS system where you can see all the tyres pressure in the MID. It's again some kind of passive system that is integrated with ABS system and if it detects low pressure in the tyre it will just throw an error or maybe a light will lit up. What all the new models got standard was puncture repair kit."

Is this true! I've been only fast charging my cellphones all the time. I thought that newer batteries are supposed to be fast charged. If fast charging will degrade batteries more, then the premise of the EV goes down a bit, isn't it?

Or is this only a Tata phenomenon?

The idea is that your daily charging at home is done using the AC slow charger, while DC fast charging is for topping up during outstation trips. The problem with that is the pathetic abysmal charging speed that Tata EVs are capable of. Their AC charging is capped at just 3kw, and fast charging is a laughable 25kw. For comparison, new age EVs from premium brands have 20-25kw as their AC slow charging, while fast charging is 10 times that. Even the likes of Kona and ZS slow charge at a decent 7kw and fast charge at 50."

Fast charging generates lot of heat and no matter what a phone brand claims it will degrade your battery faster. If you switch to a new phone every two years then it isn't big of deal, but if you plan to hold your device longer, then its best to use slow charger and use fast charging when you are in a hurry. For e.g I used to charge my work iPhone 11 with my iPad charger, the battery health stands at 81% whereas my personal device which is an iPhone X that I use to charge with the 5W charger is still at 87%.

For EVs excessive fast charging will degrade them quicker and they will lose the range as cells become weak and they cannot hold the charge efficiently. Manufacturers usually keep some buffer in the battery pack and they release it to balance the degradation. So its going to be a while before you actually see a significant drop in range.

Bottomline is if you are doing lot of trips then it makes sense to top up your car at fast charger, but otherwise Fast Charging turns out to be more expensive than home charging. Which beats the purpose of any savings in the first place."

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"No doubt about the fact that Tata deserves kudos for setting the nascent EV space in India on fire with an offering like the Nexon; but that doesn't mean customers have to be subjected to shabby after-sales service. The consistently poor after-sales record of Tata Motors is a major deterrent for customers who would want to repose their trust in them.

As GTO said, a lot of customers who've taken a leap of faith and gone ahead with an EV purchase are definitely going to be unwitting beta-testers for the company. IMHO, buying an EV for the next 5 years atleast doesn't seem to be entirely viable. Hope the technology and the required infrastructure for the same is fine-tuned and set-up properly by then. Personally would like to see an EV with an enhanced range, considering my own travel requirements."
Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"My experience with Nexon EV in last 1 year:

1a. D2N - Faced it once when I bought the car in Aug 2020. It was not exactly D2N, but the car was not shifting to D from N. Multiple restarts, solved the issue. There was an ECU update after a week and haven't seen the issue after that. The car had come with the worst VCU version during delivery which always showed 312KM range after every recharge and refused to go down. I used to regularly see 200KM DTE range with 50% remaining battery.

1b. HV Critical Error: This is a variant of D2N and most cases of D2N will be accompanied by this error message displayed on the MID. I have seen this twice and the last one was in Aug 2021. But it cleared whenever I restarted the car. Both the times I've seen this error, I had started the car directly by pressing Brake Pedal+Start button. There is an Unofficial guideline among Tata Whatsapp/Telegram groups and even Service Advisors that you should do a 3 step start process as below.
1. Press Start Button without Brake pedal which takes the car to ICE Equivalent of Accessories (ACC) mode
2. Press Start button again without Brake pedal which moves it to the ICE equivalent of Ignition Mode where your MID becomes active and Dials do a sweep.
3. Now Press Start Button with Brake Pedal pressed and you are ready to drive.
I always follow the above steps when I am outside home because I dont want to get stuck waiting for a tow van. If I am on an outstation trip, I follow a 6 step start process where step 1 starts with a prayer to Jesus, a prayer to Allah before step 2 and a final prayer to Lord Vishnu before step 3. I am happy to say that this works 100% and would recommend Tata to add these steps to their Owners Manual.

2.SOC Drop: This issue started reporting after the latest Software update. I haven't updated my software yet, and hence havent faced this. However, I will be giving the vehicle for service soon during which they might update the SW to have this new feature. .

3a. Fast Charger Gun getting stuck: I face this issue most of the time. I am no longer worried as I know what to do to get it unstuck. It goes like this:
1. Lock - UnLock the car multiple times using your Key Fob. Try pulling the charger gun.
2. Release and engage hand brake multiple times. Go back to the charger gun and try releasing it.
3. Press Start-Stop button and few other buttons. You can press any buttons on your console, Its just to convince your mind that you have tried everything.
4. If it still doesn't release, you move on to attack the Fast Charger. You start with buttons on FC if any. Most of them are touch screens, so I touch everything that has some symbols.
5. Next is the Red emergency Stop Button on the Fast Charger. Many a times this works for releasing the gun, but it also messes up the FC station and people wont be able to use that station for sometime or even some days.
6. Next step needs careful observation, foresight and good awareness of the surroundings. You have to switch off the mains power supply to FC Station. This is the first thing I check before entering any FC Station. For most FC station, the Mains DB is locked, but nowadays I could see them kept open for situations like this. If locked you need to follow the wiring to the transformer or the post which will have some large fuses that you can pull. However as I said, awareness and foresight is important here else you could get killed by electrocution or get beaten up by locals or even get arrested. This is a skill I acquired over an year of helplessness and hardwork, and I dont recommend any one doing it without the required skills. I had even blacked out a mall basement parking area to unlock my car and the Security didnt have any idea what had happened, nor did the CCTV.
7. There is a final step where you can unlatch manually by rotating the locking actuator from under the wheel well, but the issues are 1, it breaks easily and 2, there are lot of exposed wires and you never know what you are touching, especially with a 400V DC charger connected.
3b. Fast Charger not working: This is most common issue I face. This ranks first among all other issues mentioned. Tata always blame the charger, but there were instances where mine didnt work while the next guy in a Kona or ZS charges from the same charger while I wait there. The troubleshooting steps are almost same as above.

4. Motor Mounts This is a part of recall. All cars are getting this re-inforcement. My motor is still intact and I hope the motor remains there until I can get the reinforcement.

5. Link Rod Yet to face issues with link rod. I have to check if my vehicle have a link rod. With Tatas I know that if I dont face a common issue, then I dont have that feature/part installed.

6. Slow Charger not Charging Apart from earthing, this issue is also associated with the Locking Actuator not working. I many cases, manually locking the gun from under the wheel well starts the charging process. The locking actuator mechanism is exposed under the rear wheel well and all mud and dirt from tyre causes the mechanism to get stuck. I hope Tata do a recall to cover up the system from tyre debris.

7. Boot Lock Failure Many people in Nexon groups have faced this. Tata has been replacing the lock under warranty. Mine is good so far."

Tata had their reasons for using 3KW charging system, first of all 3 phase connections are not available everywhere that will support 7KW of charging, secondly the cost would have also increased. Nexon wasn’t developed to compete with Kona or ZS EV. You are comparing the cars of premium segment with Nexon which is not a fair comparison. If that was the case then Kona should have helped Hyundai gain 70% market share in electric vehicles category and should be the highest selling EV in the country.
Nexon owners don’t bring their cars home everyday with 0% charge and then wait for it to charge to 100%, even if I charge my car from 30% to 80% it just take few hours and that too when I am sleeping. In terms of fast charging for a 30 KWh battery pack a 25 KW charger is more than enough. In less than hour I can charge my car’s battery enough to carry on with my trip.

Its easy to say its laughable that car’s fast charging is capped at 25 KW, but what is more laughable is seeing the Kona’s and ZS EV charge at Tata Power charging station @25 KW because majority Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities currently don’t have the infrastructure to support reliable power supply for anything more than that. In fact some charging station from Tata Power has to be powered by a back up generator because power supply isn’t consistent. The funniest thing is that in my city the MG dealership has a fast charger that is installed by Tata Power and is 25KW.
Try taking a trip to Himachal and see the power distribution infrastructure there. Statiq recently put up a 20KW charger in Jabli, ask them what stopped them from putting a 50KW charger there. What sounds cool on paper doesn’t always workout in real world.

Porsche Taycan comes with 800V architecture that supports charging at 350 kw, but look at the irony that majority of the chargers in US are 50 KW which will “eventually” be upgraded to 150 and 350 KW.
But Porsche has promised that it will setup a number of 350KW chargers by 2025. Atleast one can brag about it till 2025."

It is sad that the top-selling EV in our country has such high levels of issues. I do hope that these are sorted out quickly. The customers who buy these vehicles are supporting green and Indian tech. They should be made to fell good about owning the EVs. Should not be made to regret the decision.

On a positive note: Owning a Tata EV will bring faith in you! And empirically it seems to help!

"Just saw this video on YouTube related to heating up of the Nexon EV battery pack due to fast charging at an ambient temperature of 34 C. Looks like Tata has to still work on its cooling system or there is some kind of sensor issue with this particular EV. One can skip the video to 10:55 to see the telltale indications on the instrument cluster.

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"Hello Everyone,

I have been one of the very early buyers of the Nexon EV and also unfortunately also one of the early sellers as well. I have been connected with others owners of the car since more than 18-20 months now via whatsapp and Telegram etc. There are dedicated groups from owners to help each other out as well as bring issues to the notice of Tata. There are some facts though which is serious affecting the ownership experience of the NexonEV owners.

1. The initial owners faced a lot of issues with the car and our range was never even near to what we were told during the pre-sales process. It was told that 260-270 was the real world range ( under any conditions with ac ) while we only got 150-160 at the start.
2. After a lot of efforts, we somehow reached to the TML management which whom we had this 3 hour meeting which you can check at this link
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjBSHWrp_Jc

3. Output from the meeting was that it was decided that TML would help us out with the issues and solve them for us. This is where things started to go down the wrong lane.
4. Owners started facing one issue after other and had a lot of reliability issues as well as issues like D2N and other safety issues cropped up.
5. We sent them around 118 emails on behalf of the group while hardly 2-3 responses from them. The so called single point of contact that was assigned never responded to us.
6. As a road safety measure we literally pleaded Tata to issue an advisory to all nexon ev owners about the issue and ask them to not use the cars on highway runs. This request was also ignored. Ideally in such a case, a recall should have been done but to this day the D2N issue has not been resolved and they are selling vehicles when the safety issue still exists.
7. As a new and version 1 product, most owners were ok with working through a few niggles. That is the reason why we made efforts to reach out to them to get solutions. However, after more than 20 months after the launch, if the majority issues still exist and are related to safety then it is not a good sign.
8. No doubt it is a half baked product but the more alarming thing is the missing technical know-how at Tata on how to handle the issues once reported.

Over the one year and even more, we have seen numerous issues reported from issues where there have been no solutions or the solutions have been just work around. This does not inspire confidence in owners in any way. Plus the fact also remains is identical cars behave very differently. Some cars are good and have had no issues while some have had so many issues that we have lost count. My own car initially had only the low range issue, but after it went for the first service the trail of issues just went on and on until finally I was fed up and had to sell the car because there was no ownership on the issues.

Best of luck to nexon ev owners but on a serious note, people should wait for 2 more generations of this product but it would be worth its price which I am saying based on personal experience and the issues reported by existing owners."

Thanks. This post is really helpful.

Can you please clarify the following :
1. What was the wh consumption when the range was bad ?
2. Was there any improvement in range over time and updates ?
3. Did you / group come across any new issues other than the ones discussed here (range, fast charging, struck gun and some mechanical issues) ? If so, please help with some details.
4. See that you upgraded to a ZS EV, What is the real life range with ZS ?

I may be in the market for an EV soon and your responses will really help."

Well, that we never knew how bad it was. Problem was no matter what range we got, consumption was 119wh/km and something around 140-150. However, once Tata released some fixes for this, at least my car could see around 135-150 wh/km as bare minimum. The best range I could get was around 190 kms in 90% soc with sedate driving ( as last 10% in the nexon is barely usable due to limited speed and no AC)
2. Was there any improvement in range over time and updates ?
The only improvements we could see is consistency in consumption. However, some cars like mine had weird issues altogether. Like my car did not take proper intake of charge many times. 1% to 100% soc was sometimes 23kw, sometimes 25kw and sometimes even 28kw. So range was fluctuating as well. It all came down to a stage when my car could not charge. Some days before this situation, it started taking 16-18 hours to charge and then at one time could not charge. This is just an example of the charging issue I had. I also had a scare with an accident which happened due to the D2N issue where in a two wheeler almost ran into the back of my vehicle due to sudden loss of speed for my vehicle. One pathetic day vehicle did not start at all when I wanted to leave for a trip with family @ 5am in the morning. All displays and electricals were completely dead and I had charged to 100% soc just 6 hours before this event. I never got any explanation of any events.
3. Did you / group come across any new issues other than the ones discussed here (range, fast charging, struck gun and some mechanical issues) ? If so, please help with some details.
There have been many new issues but the instances of those have been isolated to few instances. An example I can give is weird suspension noise during driving.
4. See that you upgraded to a ZS EV, What is the real life range with ZS ?
I drive the ZS in the ICE way with speeds between 80-100 on highway runs and around 40-60 in city. I use the cruise control as much as I can and have been getting a consistent range of around 310-320 kms since day 1. I have driven around 6500kms so far. Overall except for the weak headlights I am overall very happy with the product as a whole.


The biggest problem with Tata is the following:
1. They do not want to accept that issues exist even if you demonstrate them.
2. There is no accountability about any event.
3. Technical know-how is missing at service centers.
4. There is no two way communication.
5. Customer service and post sales service is absent at TML.
6. Right up to the MD and CEO of the company, no matter how serious issue you report to them, they hardly care.
7. You are at the mercy of either finding someone sensible at the service center or your own luck to be able to get good ownership experience with TML cars.
8. The limitations on their EVs are not explained every by anyone of their sales channels. Like slow on board charger is a real limitation for long journeys when combined with the limited range in real world their cars offer..

When buying a TML EV car, please make sure you have a backup ICE car for highway usage and are ready to experience 0 customer service. Rest is your call.. Best of Luck.."

Thanks. These inputs are helpful.

Actually, Tata service experience has been wonderful for me so far (across multiple service centers), need to see if it changes with an EV, IF (big one) I decide to buy one.

Recently, I have made it a habit to speak to EV owners, wherever possible. Spoke to few owners of Nexon EV and found that models after Dec 2020 seem to be stable with minimal issues.

All the best with your ZS and wishing you many more electric kilometers"

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"I heard from a colleague about rat chewing through the cables in a Nexon EV in their community. When I googled to see how common this is, I came across this article that says that lately car manufacturers are using wiring insulation that is made out of Soy for environmental reasons, but it makes the material more attractive for rodents. Is it possible that Tata is doing the same with Nexon EV wiring?"

In this case, this should be a common issue with all Nexons right ? OR will there be a need to use Soy based insulation only for EVs ?"

Good question, I don't know enough to guess if Nexon EVs somehow deserved a different kind of wiring than traditional Nexons. It is also possible that the person just got unlucky even if Tata Motors is not using Soy based wiring."

"I'm from Goa too and planning on buying a Nexon EV.
Overall how has your experience been with the car other than the charging issue and the rod replacement highlighted by you?
Also, what has been the full range achieved by you on a full charge?
Information on this would be really helpful especially for me as we would be driving on similar terrains in Goa!"
Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
"My nexon ev woes continues. There has been a knocking/vibrating sound ever since the delivery when pressing the accelerator. They have checked everything from the mounts to suspension. Car is still with the service centre. Apparently tata team is working on it and they are unable to solve the issue. Post delivery the car has been with me for only 3 days since last month and a half. My first and last Tata product. Everything from sales, delivery to after sales has been pathetic. This is from Rudra motors, wagholi, Pune."

Re: Issues & niggles with the Tata Nexon EV
I see that there haven't been any new posts in the last 6 months. Just wanted to understand if the problems cited in this thread continue to show up in later models ? Are there any updates that Tata might have issued that fix some of these problems ?

Are you hearing of these issues in the Nexon groups even in the models produced later? Has Tata managed to fix these issues in the subsequent production runs?

Any inputs would be very helpful. I'm thinking of picking up the newly launched EV Max variant for short highway runs and am very keen to know how the reliability has been."

I am a part of NEV (Nexon EV) pune group. No niggles apart from car charger getting overheated in this temp so all you need is to switch off the charger and switch on. Sometimes the onboard tyre pressure error pops up which goes away by resetting the tpms.

Hopefully no niggles going forward as even I am a new NEV owner.


I have the XM variant and for some reason with all the talk about safety by TM my car doesn't have the speed activated door lock. Yesterday my daughter opened the rear door while the car was being parked. I dont know if higher variants have this ""safety feature""."

"We must keep in mind that unlike other manufacturers, MG cannot freely bring in investment from its parent due to restrictions on investments from China. This would have certainly imposed constraints on capacity.

Despite these challenges i think they have done a commendable job"

If I remember, this feature was removed to get higher safety rating or something. I could be wrong though. So you need to manually lock the door."
